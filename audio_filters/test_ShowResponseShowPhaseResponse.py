================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Input Data
Issue: The function `show_phase_response` takes a filter_type as an argument, and uses this directly in processing input without any type of validation or error handling. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the wrong type of object or malicious data is passed in.
Solution: Implement validation checks for the `filter_type` argument to ensure it is of the expected type and contains valid data. Also, add error handling to catch and handle potential exceptions that may occur during processing.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of External Libraries
Issue: The matplotlib and numpy libraries are used in the code without checking the versions of these libraries. Insecure versions of these libraries could expose the application to known vulnerabilities.
Solution: Check and ensure the versions of matplotlib and numpy being used are up to date and do not have known vulnerabilities. This can be done by checking the versions of these libraries at runtime and comparing them to a list of secure versions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid FilterType and Samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_valid_filter_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response generates the correct phase response when provided valid filter_type and samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a valid samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase response without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle valid inputs and generate the correct phase response. It verifies that the function meets its specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: FilterType with Different Sizes
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_different_filter_sizes
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response generates correct phase responses for FilterType objects of different sizes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize several FilterType objects with different sizes.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with each FilterType and a valid samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the correct phase response for each FilterType.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle FilterType objects of different sizes. It verifies that the function is robust and flexible, meeting its specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Large Samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_large_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response can handle a large samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a large samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase response without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle large samplerates. It verifies that the function is robust and can meet its specifications and business requirements in various situations.

Scenario 4: Negative Samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_negative_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response handles a negative samplerate appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a negative samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle invalid inputs and raise appropriate errors. It verifies that the function is robust and meets its specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 5: Zero Samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_zero_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response handles a samplerate of zero appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a samplerate of zero.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle edge cases and raise appropriate errors. It verifies that the function is robust and meets its specifications and business requirements.
