================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Outdated Libraries (no specific CWE or CVE)
Issue: Out-of-date libraries may contain vulnerabilities that have been fixed in more recent versions.
Solution: Regularly update all libraries used in your code to their latest versions to ensure you are not exposed to fixed vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful plot of phase response using IIR Filter 
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_successful_iir_filter
  Description: This test should verify that the phase response of the filter is correctly plotted when an IIRFilter is used.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of IIRFilter will be created with a suitable order - for instance, 4.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the created IIRFilter instance and a sample rate of 48000.
  Assert: No assertions will be done as the function does not return any value. Instead, it will be assumed to have passed if no exceptions are thrown. 
Validation:
  Rationale: The specification of the function involves plotting the filter response of a filter_type. Thus, this test verifies that the function can achieve this task successfully for IIRFilter.

Scenario 2: Check the zero-padding is done correctly for samplerate higher than size.
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_padding_correct
  Description: The test will determine if the phase response is correct when the value of samplerate is more significant than size suggesting the need for zero-padding.
Execution:
  Arrange: Any suitable filter type will be created, say FIRFilter with adequate parameters.
  Act: The function show_phase_response will be invoked with FIRFilter instance and samplerate more than 512.
  Assert: Similar to before, no direct values can be asserted. It can be assumed that if the function runs without errors, the behaviour was as expected. 
Validation:
  The ability to handle samplerates more significant than size forms part of the business logic within this function. This test verifies that the function correctly manages such a scenario.

Scenario 3: Testing large negative inputs which would lead to a phase shift of -2pi
Details:
  TestName: test_large_negative_inputs
  Description: This scenario tests whether the response would allow for a shift of -2*pi when large negative inputs are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: A suitable FilterType will be created and a samplerate with a large negative value would be found.
  Act: The function show_phase_response will be invoked with the created FilterType instance and the large negative samplerate.
  Assert: Similar to before, there are no direct values to be asserted. However, if the function runs without errors, the behaviour was as expected. 
Validation:
  This test is important because it tests the function's ability to handle the edge case of large negative inputs. If successful, it shows that the graph can plot a phase shift of -2pi.  

Scenario 4: Test for single input data which would cause a phase shift of 0
Details:
  TestName: test_single_input_phase_shift
  Description: This test verifies whether the function can handle the edge case where only one input data point is provided, which should imply a phase shift of 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: A suitable FilterType will be created.
  Act: The function show_phase_response would be called with the FilterType and the samplerate set to 1.
  Assert: Similar to before, the outcome is checked by the absence of errors.
Validation:
  The function should be able to handle all kinds of scenarios, and this test verifies whether the function correctly computes and plots the phase response for a single data point.
