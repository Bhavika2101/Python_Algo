================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Input Data
Issue: The function 'show_phase_response' accepts any object as 'filter_type' and uses its 'process' method without any type checking or validation. This can lead to unhandled exceptions or execution of unintended code if a malicious or incorrect object is passed.
Solution: Implement type checking to ensure that 'filter_type' is an instance of the expected class or implements a known interface. Also, consider using exception handling to catch and handle potential errors.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-78)
Issue: The use of matplotlib.pyplot's 'show' method can potentially open an interactive window or even execute arbitrary commands depending on the backend used and the specific environment configuration. This can be exploited if the environment or matplotlib's configuration are manipulated by an attacker.
Solution: Ensure that the environment in which the script is run is secure and that matplotlib's configuration is set properly. Consider using a non-interactive backend or disabling interactive mode in matplotlib.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid FilterType and Samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_valid_filter_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response generates the correct phase response when provided valid FilterType and samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a valid samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase response without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle valid inputs and generate the correct phase response. It verifies that the function meets its specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: FilterType with Different Sizes
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_different_filter_sizes
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response can handle FilterType objects with different sizes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize FilterType objects with varying sizes.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType objects and a valid samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase responses without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle FilterType objects of different sizes. It verifies that the function is flexible and robust.

Scenario 3: Large Samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_large_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response can handle a large samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a large samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and large samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase response without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle large samplerates. It verifies that the function is robust and can handle a wide range of inputs.

Scenario 4: Samplerate Smaller than Filter Size
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_small_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response can handle a samplerate that is smaller than the size of the FilterType object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a samplerate that is smaller than the size of the FilterType.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and small samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase response without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle a samplerate that is smaller than the size of the FilterType object. It verifies that the function is robust and can handle a wide range of inputs.
