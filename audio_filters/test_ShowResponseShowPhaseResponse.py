================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input validation
Issue: The function show_phase_response does not validate its input which may lead to unexpected errors and behaviour.
Solution: Ensure to validate inputs for show_phase_response function especially when the inputs are used in mathematical operations and array indexing.

Vulnerability: External dependency usage
Issue: Heavy usage of external libraries such as numpy and matplotlib could lead to security vulnerabilities if the said libraries aren't properly secured and updated.
Solution: Make use of virtual environments and keep your dependencies up-to-date and secured. This will ensure that no deprecated or insecure versions of libraries are being utilized.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate Phase Response of the Filter
Details:
  TestName: test_get_phase_response
  Description: The test will verify that the phase response of the filter is correctly displayed, evaluating the correctness of FFT transformation and the appropriateness of the plotted data.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the FilterType will be created with predefined parameters.
  Act: The show_phase_response function will be invoked with the created filter and a representative samplerate.
  Assert: The data processed by np.angle(np.fft.fft(outputs)) should be correctly plotted on the chart. The test can wrap a mock around matplotlib.pyplot to capture the data passed for plotting and validate it against expected results.
Validation:
  This test validates the core logic of the function, showing the correctness of FFT transformation from the process method of FilterType. It further ensures that the plotting library receives correct information for display.

Scenario 2: Validate Zero-Padding
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_padding
  Description: The test should validate the correctness of the zero-padding implementation.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the FilterType will be created and the size of inputs array is known.
  Act: The show_phase_response function will be invoked with the created filter and a representative samplerate.
  Assert: The length of the final outputs array after padding should match 'samplerate', which validates that correct number of zero-paddings are added.
Validation:
  The success of this test will show that the implementation correctly pads the frequency response with zeros to ensure that the FFT correctly interprets the phases at higher frequencies. 

Scenario 3: Filter Input/Output Sanity Check
Details:
  TestName: test_filter_sanity
  Description: The test verifies that the 'process' method of the FilterType is correctly invoked and its outputs are handled correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: A mock implementation of FilterType will be used that has a clearly defined 'process' output for known inputs.
  Act: The show_phase_response function will be called with the mock filter and a representative samplerate.
  Assert: The outputs array in the function should match the clearly defined 'process' outputs from the mock filter.
Validation:
  This test validates the business logic encapsulated by the function show_phase_response by ensuring that the method within the filter type is correctly invoked and used.

Scenario 4: Validate Scaling and Axis Labels of Plot
Details:
  TestName: test_plot_scaling_and_labels
  Description: This test verifies the correctness of scaling in the plot and the appropriate setting of axis labels.
Execution:
  Arrange: A dummy FilterType will be created. A mock will be wrapped around matplotlib.pyplot.
  Act: The show_phase_response function will be invoked with the created filter.
  Assert: The function calls for the scaling and setting of axis labels in matplotlib.pyplot should be appropriately invoked.
Validation:
  This test allows validation of 'visual accuracy', ensuring that not only the plotted data is accurate, but also correctly represented on the graph with appropriate scaling and labels.
