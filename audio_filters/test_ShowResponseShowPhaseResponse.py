================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Use of Outdated Libraries
Issue: The code uses third-party libraries (matplotlib, numpy) which could have vulnerabilities if they are outdated or misconfigured.
Solution: Keep all third-party libraries up-to-date and follow best practices for their configuration. Regularly check for any reported vulnerabilities in these libraries and update or patch as necessary.

Vulnerability: Potential Untrusted Inputs
Issue: The filter_type.process(item) could be a potential security concern, depending on its implementation and the source of 'item'. If 'item' is from an untrusted source, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure that all inputs are validated and sanitized before use. If possible, limit the types of inputs that can be processed. Implement error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid FilterType and Samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_valid_filter_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response generates the correct phase response when provided valid filter_type and samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a valid samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase response without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle valid inputs and generate the correct phase response. It verifies that the function meets its specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: FilterType with Different Sizes
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_different_filter_sizes
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response generates correct phase responses for FilterType objects of different sizes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize several FilterType objects with different sizes.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with each FilterType and a valid samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the correct phase response for each FilterType.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle FilterType objects of different sizes and still generate the correct phase response. It verifies the function's flexibility and robustness.

Scenario 3: Lower Limit Samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_lower_limit_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response handles the lower limit of the samplerate correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a samplerate at its lower limit.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and lower limit samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase response without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle the lower limit of the samplerate correctly. It verifies the function's robustness and adherence to its specifications.

Scenario 4: Upper Limit Samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_upper_limit_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response handles the upper limit of the samplerate correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a samplerate at its upper limit.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and upper limit samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase response without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle the upper limit of the samplerate correctly. It verifies the function's robustness and adherence to its specifications.

Scenario 5: Invalid FilterType
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_invalid_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response handles an invalid FilterType correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an invalid FilterType object and a valid samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the invalid FilterType and valid samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle invalid inputs correctly by raising an appropriate error. It verifies the function's robustness and error handling capabilities.
