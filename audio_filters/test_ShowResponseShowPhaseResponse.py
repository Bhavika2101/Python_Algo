================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Input Data
Issue: The function 'show_phase_response' accepts any object as 'filter_type' and uses its 'process' method without any type checking or validation. This can lead to unhandled exceptions or execution of unintended code if a malicious or incorrect object is passed.
Solution: Implement type checking to ensure that 'filter_type' is an instance of the expected class or implements a known interface. Also, consider using exception handling to catch potential errors when calling the 'process' method.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Third-Party Libraries
Issue: The matplotlib and numpy libraries are imported and used without any version control or checks for known vulnerabilities. This can open the application to exploitation if insecure versions of these libraries are installed.
Solution: Use a dependency management tool to specify secure versions of these libraries. Regularly update dependencies and check for known vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: Potential Denial of Service
Issue: The 'show_phase_response' function creates a list of size 'samplerate', which can be an arbitrary large number. This can lead to excessive memory consumption and potentially crash the application if a large value is provided.
Solution: Implement input validation to limit the range of acceptable values for 'samplerate'. Consider using a generator or other memory-efficient data structure instead of a list for large data sets.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid FilterType and Samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_valid_filter_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response generates the correct phase response when provided valid FilterType and samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a valid samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase response without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle valid inputs and generate the correct phase response. It verifies that the function meets its specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: FilterType with Different Processes
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_different_filter_processes
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response generates different phase responses for different FilterType processes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two FilterType objects with different process methods.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with each FilterType.
  Assert: Check that the function generates different phase responses for the different FilterTypes.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly calculates the phase response based on the FilterType's process. It verifies that the function is working correctly with the business logic encapsulated in the FilterType.

Scenario 3: Large Samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_large_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response can handle a large samplerate without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a large samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType and large samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase response without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle large samplerates, which might be required in some business scenarios. It verifies that the function meets its specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 4: FilterType Process Returns Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_zero_filter_process
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response can handle a FilterType process that returns zero without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object with a process method that returns zero.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized FilterType.
  Assert: Check that the function generates the phase response without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle a FilterType process that returns zero, which might be a valid scenario in some business cases. It verifies that the function meets its specifications and business requirements.
