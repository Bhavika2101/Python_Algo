Scenario 1: Validating the phase response of a filter with a small sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_small_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response correctly computes and plots the phase response of a filter when the sample rate is small.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter (FilterType object) and a small sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the filter and the small sample rate as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the plot is displayed correctly with the expected phase response.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly with small sample rates. The expected result is that the phase response is computed and plotted correctly, which is crucial for the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Validating the phase response of a filter with a large sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_large_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response correctly computes and plots the phase response of a filter when the sample rate is large.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter (FilterType object) and a large sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the filter and the large sample rate as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the plot is displayed correctly with the expected phase response.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly with large sample rates. The expected result is that the phase response is computed and plotted correctly, which is vital for the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Validating the phase response of a filter with zero sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_zero_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_phase_response correctly handles the case where the sample rate is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter (FilterType object) and a zero sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the filter and the zero sample rate as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases. The expected result is an error, as a zero sample rate is not valid for this function. This is crucial for the function's specifications and business requirements.
