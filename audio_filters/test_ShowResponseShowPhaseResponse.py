================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Inadvertent System State Disclosure (CWE-200)
Issue: The 'show_phase_response' function may throw unhandled exceptions directly to the user, potentially revealing system state information.
Solution: Implement exception handling blocks to catch possible exceptions and display user-friendly messages, avoiding system state disclosure.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (CWE-80)
Issue: The generation of plots using Matplotlib, if used within a web context, could potentially create an opportunity for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if user-provided data is not sanitized properly.
Solution: Although not directly involved in this code snippet, if user-provided data is passed into matplotlib plots, ensure that all user input is properly sanitized before using in a web context.

Vulnerability: Potential Memory Leak
Issue: Creating a large-size numpy array and not freeing it after use may cause memory to leak.
Solution: Make sure to remove or dereference data structure after use if it's no longer needed, especially when handling large data or in a long running process.

Vulnerability: Missing import validation (CWE-494)
Issue: The script directly imports several modules without any validation.
Solution: Verify that all imported modules are expected, trusted, and secure. Comparing checksums or using digital signatures could be an approach.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verifying the function with different filter types
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_filter_types
  Description: This test ensures that show_phase_response function supports different types of filters and produces expected phase response visuals.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create different filter types using a FilterType object.
  Act: Invoke the show_phase_response method with filter_type set to various filter types and samplerate as 48000.
  Assert: Check the creation of the plot for all filter types.
Validation: 
  It is necessary to ensure that the function operates with various filter types as filters processing capabilities are a key component of the method's business logic.

Scenario 2: Testing the function with different sample rates
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_response_different_sample_rates
  Description: This test verifies that the function generates appropriate phase response visuals when provided with different sample rates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Decide on various samplerate values.
  Act: Invoke show_phase_response method with a FilterType object and the different sample rates.
  Assert: The function should create a plot corresponding to each sample rate.
Validation:
  The sample rate directly influences the frequency limits, filter output, and thus plot of the phase response. This test ensures the function can handle different sample rates correctly, reflecting its ability to adapt to a variety of audio processing requirements.

Scenario 3: Boundary Testing - Testing the maximum allowable sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_max_sample_rate
  Description: The main goal of this test is to ensure that the function can handle the maximum sample rate allowable by the system.
Execution:
  Arrange: Determine the maximum sample rate supported by the system.
  Act: Invoke the show_phase_response method with a FilterType object and the maximum sample rate.
  Assert: The function should create a plot indicative of the maximum sample rate.
Validation:
  This extreme scenario is significant for ensuring that the function properly handles the highest possible sample rates, ensuring robustness in different operating environments. 

Scenario 4: Boundary Testing - Testing the minimum allowable sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_min_sample_rate
  Description: This test's main goal is to ascertain whether the function can handle the minimum sample rate allowable by the system.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ascertain the minimum sample rate supported by the system.
  Act: Invoke show_phase_response method with a FilterType object and the minimum sample rate.
  Assert: The function should create a plot indicative of the minimum sample rate.
Validation:
  This test scenario is critical for making sure that the function properly handles the lowest possible sample rates, ensuring high adaptability across various filter applications. 

Scenario 5: Testing function when filter doesn't modify input
Details:
  TestName: test_show_phase_pass_through_filter
  Description: This test verifies the output of show_phase_response when given a pass-through filter (a filter that doesn't modify the input).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a "pass-through" filter type using the FilterType object.
  Act: Invoke the show_phase_response method with the "pass-through" filter and a sample rate of 48000.
  Assert: The function should create a plot corresponding to the pass-through filter.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly plots phase response of "pass-through" filters, adding to its versatility in handling different types of filters.

# To rectify the issue above, you need to install the matplotlib package
# as it's not found in your current Python environment.
# You can do this by running the following command in the terminal command line:
# pip install matplotlib

# Importing necessary modules
import pytest
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Switching to non-gui backend for matplotlib in test environment
plt.switch_backend('agg')

# Import the testing function from its module
