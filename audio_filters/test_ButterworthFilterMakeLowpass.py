================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The function make_lowpass() does not validate its input parameters. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in case of wrong inputs.
Solution: Input parameters frequency, samplerate and q_factor should be checked if they are of correct types (int for frequency and samplerate, float for q_factor) and within expected value ranges. The checks should be implemented at the very start of the function. Adhere to the principle of fail-fast. In case of invalid input, the function should raise an exception or error.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Perfect Frequency Response of Lowpass Filter.
Details:
  TestName: test_lowpass_frequency_response
  Description: This test intends to verify that the make_lowpass function returns a perfect IIRFilter which gives a right frequency cut-off.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up frequency, samplerate and Q factor values.
  Act: Pass these values to make_lowpass function and get the filter. Use the filter coefficients to calculate frequency response.
  Assert: The frequency response should match the expected cut-off frequency.
Validation:
  This validates that the filter returned by the function is a valid lowpass filter with correct cut-off frequency as per business requirement.

Scenario 2: Frequency Value Boundary.
Details:
  TestName: test_lowpass_frequency_boundary
  Description: This test intends to verify that the make_lowpass function handles boundary frequency values correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up minimum and maximum possible frequency values.
  Act: Pass these values (one by one) to make_lowpass function and get the filter.
  Assert: The filter's coefficients should be correctly computed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles edge case for frequencies.

Scenario 3: Q Factor Value Boundary.
Details:
  TestName: test_lowpass_q_factor_boundary
  Description: This test verifies that the make_lowpass function deals with boundary values of Q factor appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up minimum and maximum possible Q factor values.
  Act: Pass these values (one by one) to make_lowpass function along with some default frequency and samplerate values and get the filter.
  Assert: The filter's coefficients should be correctly computed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_lowpass function correctly handles edge cases related to the Q factor.

Scenario 4: Correct Number of Filter Coefficients.
Details:
  TestName: test_lowpass_coefficients
  Description: This test intends to verify that the correct number of filter coefficients are returned by the make_lowpass function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up frequency, samplerate and Q factor values.
  Act: Pass these values to the make_lowpass function and get the filter.
  Assert: The number of filter coefficients should be as per the definition of a second order IIR filter.
Validation:
  This test aids in ensuring that the function operates correctly according to specification requirements by returning correct number of coefficients.

Scenario 5: Exception or Error when Samplerate is Zero.
Details:
  TestName: test_lowpass_zero_samplerate
  Description: This test verifies that make_lowpass function handles zero or very small samplerate values appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up frequency and Q factor values; samplerate is zero.
  Act: Pass these values to make_lowpass function and try to get the filter.
  Assert: An exception or error should be thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function throws an error or exception when it encounters zero or very small samplerate values, which is expected behavior as per specification.
