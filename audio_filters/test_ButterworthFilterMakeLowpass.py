Scenario 1: Validate the creation of a valid low-pass filter
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_lowpass_filter_creation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can create a valid low-pass filter based on the provided parameters. This is the core functionality of the function and must operate as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a frequency, samplerate, and q_factor.
  Act: Call the function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and that the coefficients match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can create a low-pass filter as expected. The correctness of the coefficients is crucial to the filter's operation.

Scenario 2: Validate handling of zero frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle a frequency of zero. This is an edge case that may have special behavior due to the division operation in the calculation of w0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a frequency of zero, a samplerate, and a q_factor.
  Act: Call the function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and that the coefficients match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle a frequency of zero without causing errors or incorrect results. The ability to handle edge cases like this is important for robustness.

Scenario 3: Validate handling of zero samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle a samplerate of zero. This is an edge case that may have special behavior due to the division operation in the calculation of w0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a frequency, a samplerate of zero, and a q_factor.
  Act: Call the function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle a samplerate of zero without causing errors or incorrect results. The ability to handle edge cases like this is important for robustness.

Scenario 4: Validate handling of negative frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle a negative frequency. This is an edge case that may have special behavior due to the use of frequency in the calculation of w0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative frequency, a samplerate, and a q_factor.
  Act: Call the function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle a negative frequency without causing errors or incorrect results. The ability to handle edge cases like this is important for robustness.

Scenario 5: Validate handling of negative q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle a negative q_factor. This is an edge case that may have special behavior due to the use of q_factor in the calculation of alpha.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a frequency, a samplerate, and a negative q_factor.
  Act: Call the function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle a negative q_factor without causing errors or incorrect results. The ability to handle edge cases like this is important for robustness.
