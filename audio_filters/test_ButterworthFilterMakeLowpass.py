================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unrestricted Input
Issue: The function accepts any integer as 'frequency', 'samplerate' and any float as 'q_factor', without checking if these values make sense in a physical context, potentially leading to errors or undefined behavior.
Solution: Implement input validation to restrict 'frequency', 'samplerate' and 'q_factor' to reasonable values. Raise exceptions, or sanitize and reject values outside these ranges.

Vulnerability: Dependency Security
Issue: The code depends on an external package 'audio_filters.iir_filter'. If this package contains vulnerabilities, or if it is compromised, backdoored, or outdated, your application will be vulnerable as well.
Solution: Ensure that the 'audio_filters' package is up-to-date and obtained from a trusted source. Regularly check for & apply security patches, and consider using a tool to automatically catch outdated/vulnerable dependencies.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing for positive non-zero frequency 
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowpass_positive_frequency
  Description: Tests if the function correctly creates a low-pass filter when given a positive non-zero frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: No Setup is required.
  Act: Call the make_lowpass function with a positive non-zero frequency, valid samplerate, and q_factor.
  Assert: Check if the coefficients computed result in a low-pass filter.
Validation:
  Test is required because it verifies that the function can handle normal expected parameters and that the output is as expected.

Scenario 2: Basic frequency boundary scenario - Zero frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowpass_zero_frequency
  Description: Tests if the function correctly handles zero frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: No Setup is required.
  Act: Call the make_lowpass function with frequency=0, valid samplerate and q_factor.
  Assert: Check if function correctly handles a zero frequency.
Validation:
  Test is required because it checks if the function can handle lower boundary conditions for the frequency value.

Scenario 3: Negative frequency scenario
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowpass_negative_frequency
  Description: Test if the function can correctly handle negative frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: No Setup is required.
  Act: Call the make_lowpass function with negative frequency, valid samplerate, and q_factor.
  Assert: Check if function correctly handles a negative frequency.
Validation:
  Test is required because it checks if the function will handle edge case conditions where a user supplies an abnormal frequency value.

Scenario 4: High frequency scenario
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowpass_high_frequency
  Description: Test if the function can correctly handle frequencies higher than the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: No Setup is required.
  Act: Call the make_lowpass function with a frequency higher than the samplerate and valid q_factor.
  Assert: Verify the function can correctly create a low-pass filter under such conditions.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function can handle frequencies that are higher than the samplerate.

Scenario 5: Zero q_factor scenario
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowpass_zero_qfactor
  Description: Test if the function can correctly handle a zero q_factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: No Setup is required.
  Act: Call the make_lowpass function with valid frequency, samplerate and a zero q_factor.
  Assert: Check if function correctly handles a zero q_factor.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function can correctly handle edge case conditions where the q_factor equals zero.

Scenario 6: Negative q_factor scenario
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowpass_negative_qfactor
  Description: Test if the function can correctly handle negative q_factors.
Execution:
  Arrange: No Setup is required.
  Act: Call the make_lowpass function with valid frequency, samplerate, and a negative q_factor.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly handles a negative q_factor.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function is correctly handling abnormal q_factors.
