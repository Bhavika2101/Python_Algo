================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Input Handling
Issue: The function make_allpass does not validate or sanitize its input parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially security vulnerabilities if the function is used with untrusted input.
Solution: Add checks to ensure that the input parameters are of the expected types and within the expected range. For example, frequency and samplerate should be positive integers, and q_factor should be a positive float.

Vulnerability: Dependency Security
Issue: The code is using an external library audio_filters.iir_filter. There's a risk if this library has known vulnerabilities or if it's not maintained regularly.
Solution: Regularly check for updates and known vulnerabilities of the libraries you use. Consider using a tool like PyUp Safety to automate this.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with default q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_default_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the creation of an all-pass filter using the default q_factor value. It validates the correct calculation and assignment of coefficients in the created filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with a frequency and a samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the calculated coefficients match the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected with default parameters and correctly calculates the filter coefficients.

Scenario 2: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with custom q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_custom_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the creation of an all-pass filter using a custom q_factor value. It validates that the function correctly takes into account the q_factor in the calculation of the coefficients.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with a frequency, a samplerate, and a custom q_factor.
  Assert: Check if the calculated coefficients match the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly applies the q_factor parameter in the calculation of the filter coefficients.

Scenario 3: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with extreme frequency values
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_extreme_frequency_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify the creation of an all-pass filter using extreme frequency values. It validates the function's behavior in edge cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with extreme frequency values and a samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the calculated coefficients match the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected in edge cases and correctly calculates the filter coefficients.

Scenario 4: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with extreme samplerate values
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_extreme_samplerate_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify the creation of an all-pass filter using extreme samplerate values. It validates the function's behavior in edge cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with a frequency and extreme samplerate values.
  Assert: Check if the calculated coefficients match the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected in edge cases and correctly calculates the filter coefficients.

Scenario 5: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with invalid parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_invalid_parameters
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when it is called with invalid parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with invalid parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function raises an error as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles invalid parameters and raises an error as expected.
