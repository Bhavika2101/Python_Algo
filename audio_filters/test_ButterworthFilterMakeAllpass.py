================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated user input
Issue: The filter creation function does not validate the provided frequency or samplerate. If either of these values is negative or zero, it may cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Wrap the function's logic with error-handling code that tests the validity of these frequency and samplerate values. Check if they're greater than 0 before proceeding.

Vulnerability: Insecure use of external library
Issue: The 'audio_filters.iir_filter.IIRFilter' package's input is not validated, which can lead to negative consequences if the package has any security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure the external library used is up to date and is trustworthy. Validate any output it generates and sanitize any input given to it.

Vulnerability: Potential Denial of Service (DoS)
Issue: If excessively high values for frequency or samplerate are provided, the computational resources used by the sin and cos functions could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Implement limitations on the range of accepted values for frequency and samplerate to prevent excessive computational load.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Allpass Filter Creation
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the make_allpass function produces a valid IIRFilter object with the correct coefficients for a given frequency, samplerate and q_factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the frequency as 500, the samplerate as 48000, and the q_factor as 1 / sqrt(2).
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the instantiated parameters.
  Assert: The returned object should be an instance of IIRFilter, and its coefficients should be as expected by running the coefficients algorithm against parameters.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly creates all-pass filters. This is important as the role of this function is to prepare the properties of the all-pass filter, which impacts the sound adjustment that the filter introduces.

Scenario 2: High Frequency Value
Details:
  TestName: test_high_frequency
  Description: This test aims to verify the function's response when provided with a frequency value greater than the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the frequency value as 50000 and the samplerate as 48000.
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the instantiated parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter coefficients are generated properly considering a higher frequency than samplerate.
Validation:
  This test confirms how the function responds to edge cases relating to frequency range. Ensuring correct response within these boundaries is essential as it relates to acoustics processing and influences the quality and nature of sound produced.

Scenario 3: Negative Q-Factor
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_qfactor
  Description: This test examines the function's response to a negative q_factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the q_factor with a negative value (like -1).
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the instantiated parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter coefficients are computed properly when q_factor is negative.
Validation:
  This ensures that the function adequately handles negative q_factor values. Maintaining proper function in these cases is important since parameters may be programmatically set, and we must guarantee that the output will not break subsequent parts of the system.

Scenario 4: Zero Q-Factor
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_qfactor
  Description: This test is designed to examine the function's response when the q_factor input is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the value of q_factor to 0.
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the instantiated parameters.
  Assert: An exception should be thrown as dividing by zero in alpha computation would occur.
Validation:
  This is important as it assesses how the make_allpass function handles input that could generate computational errors, ensuring the stability of the sound processing system.
