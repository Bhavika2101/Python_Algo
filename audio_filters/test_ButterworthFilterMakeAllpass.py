================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Input Handling
Issue: The function make_allpass does not validate or sanitize its input parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially security vulnerabilities if the function is used with untrusted input.
Solution: Add checks to ensure that the input parameters are of the expected types and within the expected range. For example, frequency and samplerate should be positive integers, and q_factor should be a positive float.

Vulnerability: Dependency Security
Issue: The code includes the third-party package audio_filters.iir_filter. There's a risk if this package has known security vulnerabilities or if it's not maintained anymore.
Solution: Always use the latest version of third-party packages and monitor them for any known security vulnerabilities. Consider using a tool to automatically check for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, such as PyUp Safety.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with default q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_default_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the creation of an all-pass filter using the default q_factor value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency and samplerate values.
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the initialized frequency and samplerate values.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter is an instance of IIRFilter and the a_coeffs and b_coeffs values are as expected.
Validation:
  It is important to test the function's ability to generate an all-pass filter using default parameters. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and mathematical behavior.

Scenario 2: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with custom q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_custom_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the creation of an all-pass filter using a custom q_factor value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, and q_factor values.
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the initialized frequency, samplerate, and q_factor values.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter is an instance of IIRFilter and the a_coeffs and b_coeffs values are as expected.
Validation:
  It is important to test the function's ability to generate an all-pass filter with custom parameters. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and mathematical behavior.

Scenario 3: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with frequency equals to zero
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_zero_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_allpass function when the frequency value is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency as zero and samplerate value.
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the initialized frequency and samplerate values.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter is an instance of IIRFilter and the a_coeffs and b_coeffs values are as expected.
Validation:
  It is important to test the function's behavior with zero frequency. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and mathematical behavior.

Scenario 4: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with frequency equals to samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_frequency_equals_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_allpass function when the frequency value is equal to the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency and samplerate values as equal.
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the initialized frequency and samplerate values.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter is an instance of IIRFilter and the a_coeffs and b_coeffs values are as expected.
Validation:
  It is important to test the function's behavior when frequency equals samplerate. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and mathematical behavior.

Scenario 5: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with negative q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_negative_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_allpass function when the q_factor value is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, and q_factor as a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the make_allpass function with the initialized frequency, samplerate, and q_factor values.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter is an instance of IIRFilter and the a_coeffs and b_coeffs values are as expected.
Validation:
  It is important to test the function's ability to handle negative q_factor. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and mathematical behavior.
