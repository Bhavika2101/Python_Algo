```
Scenario 1: Validate make_allpass function with valid parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_valid_params
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the make_allpass function is returning an instance of IIRFilter with correctly set coefficients when valid frequency, samplerate and q_factor parameters are passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate and q_factor with valid values.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and if the a_coeffs and b_coeffs are correctly set according to the passed parameters.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the make_allpass function is correctly creating and setting up the IIRFilter object which is fundamental for the filter to function correctly.

Scenario 2: Validate make_allpass function with extreme frequency values
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_extreme_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the make_allpass function is handling extreme frequency values correctly without causing any errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency with extreme values (very high or very low), and samplerate and q_factor with valid values.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and if the a_coeffs and b_coeffs are correctly set according to the passed parameters.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the make_allpass function is robust and can handle extreme frequency values without causing any errors.

Scenario 3: Validate make_allpass function with extreme samplerate values
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_extreme_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the make_allpass function is handling extreme samplerate values correctly without causing any errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the samplerate with extreme values (very high or very low), and frequency and q_factor with valid values.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and if the a_coeffs and b_coeffs are correctly set according to the passed parameters.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the make_allpass function is robust and can handle extreme samplerate values without causing any errors.

Scenario 4: Validate make_allpass function with extreme q_factor values
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_extreme_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the make_allpass function is handling extreme q_factor values correctly without causing any errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the q_factor with extreme values (very high or very low), and frequency and samplerate with valid values.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and if the a_coeffs and b_coeffs are correctly set according to the passed parameters.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the make_allpass function is robust and can handle extreme q_factor values without causing any errors.
