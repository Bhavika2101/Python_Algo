================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Dependency
Issue: The code uses a third party library (audio_filters.iir_filter). If the library has vulnerabilities or is compromised, it can lead to security issues.
Solution: Ensure that the third party library is trusted, maintained, and up-to-date. Regularly check for updates and patches.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The function make_allpass does not validate its inputs. If invalid data is passed, it can result in unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Implement validation checks to ensure that input data is within expected ranges and types. For instance, frequency and samplerate should be non-negative integers, and q_factor should be a non-negative float.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with default q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_default_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the creation of an all-pass filter using the default q_factor value. It validates the correct calculation and assignment of coefficients in the created filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with a frequency and a samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the calculated coefficients match the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected with default parameters and correctly calculates the filter coefficients.

Scenario 2: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with custom q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_custom_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the creation of an all-pass filter using a custom q_factor value. It validates the correct calculation and assignment of coefficients in the created filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with a frequency, a samplerate, and a custom q_factor.
  Assert: Check if the calculated coefficients match the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected with custom parameters and correctly calculates the filter coefficients.

Scenario 3: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with frequency greater than samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_frequency_greater_than_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the function when the frequency is greater than the samplerate. It validates the correct calculation and assignment of coefficients in the created filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with a frequency greater than the samplerate and a q_factor.
  Assert: Check if the calculated coefficients match the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected in edge cases and correctly calculates the filter coefficients.

Scenario 4: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with negative frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_negative_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the function when a negative frequency is provided. It validates the correct calculation and assignment of coefficients in the created filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with a negative frequency, a samplerate, and a q_factor.
  Assert: Check if the calculated coefficients match the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected in edge cases and correctly calculates the filter coefficients.

Scenario 5: Testing the creation of all-pass filter with zero frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_allpass_with_zero_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the function when the frequency is zero. It validates the correct calculation and assignment of coefficients in the created filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects.
  Act: Call the make_allpass function with zero frequency, a samplerate, and a q_factor.
  Assert: Check if the calculated coefficients match the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected in edge cases and correctly calculates the filter coefficients.
