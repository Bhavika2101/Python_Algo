================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
Issue: Assertions should not be used for data validation in production code as they can be globally disabled with the '-O' Python command line switch, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Consider using proper error handling mechanisms, like exceptions, instead of assertions for data validation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid coefficients and order 
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_coefficients
  Description: This test verifies that the method behaves correctly when it is supplied with valid coefficients and order. This follows the expected or 'happy path' scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object of a certain order. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists of size order+1
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method on the IIRFilter object with the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs
  Assert: Expect that a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the IIRFilter object are as provided. No exception should be raised.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method processes valid inputs correctly, as the business logic stipulates that the coefficients should be of size order+1.

Scenario 2: Coefficients missing a_0
Details:
  TestName: test_missing_a0_coefficient
  Description: This test validates the handling of a_coeffs that are missing a_0, where default 1.0 value is expected to be used. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object. Prepare a_coeffs without a_0 and b_coeffs of size order+1. 
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method with the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs
  Assert: Expect that the a_coeffs of the IIRFilter object have a_0 as 1.0 and rest as provided. It does not raise an exception.
Validation:
  This test makes sure that business rule of using 1.0 as default a_0 coefficient value when left out is correctly implemented.

Scenario 3: Test for exception when a_coeffs size does not match order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_exception_invalid_size_a_coeffs
  Description: The test checks whether the ValueError is raised when the size of a_coeffs does not match order + 1 which is against the defined business logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs where len(a_coeffs) not equal to order+1.
  Act: Invoke set_coefficients method with prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError to be raised with appropriate message stating the correct size expected for a_coeffs.
Validation:
  This test ensures that function is checking for valid length of a_coeffs and following the business rule by rejecting invalid lengths.

Scenario 4: Test for exception when b_coeffs size does not match order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_exception_invalid_size_b_coeffs
  Description: This test checks whether ValueError is raised when the size of b_coeffs does not match order + 1 which is against the defined business logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs where len(b_coeffs) does not equal order+1.
  Act: Invoke set_coefficients method with prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Expect ValueError to be raised with appropriate message stating the correct size expected for b_coeffs.
Validation:
  This test ensures that function is following business rule by checking for valid length of b_coeffs and rejecting invalid lengths.
