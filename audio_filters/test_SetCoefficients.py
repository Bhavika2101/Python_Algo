================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The provided code does not validate the type of the a_coeffs and b_coeffs parameters. If a non-list object is provided, the code could encounter unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Add type checks to ensure that a_coeffs and b_coeffs are lists. Raise an appropriate error if they are not.

Vulnerability: Dependence on External Libraries
Issue: The code assumes that scipy is available and correctly installed. If the scipy library is not present, the code will fail.
Solution: Include a try/except block around the scipy import statement to catch a potential ImportError. Inform the user about the missing dependency and halt execution gracefully.

Vulnerability: Error Message Information Leakage
Issue: The error messages in the ValueError exceptions include potentially sensitive information about the internal state of the application (i.e., the filter order and number of coefficients). This information could be used by an attacker to gain a better understanding of the application's internals.
Solution: Consider reducing the amount of information given out in error messages. Instead of including the exact order and number of coefficients, simply state that the input was invalid.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the coefficients of the IIR filter are set correctly by checking the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks the basic functionality of the set_coefficients method, which is crucial for the correct operation of the IIR filter.

Scenario 2: Test setting coefficients with a_coeffs size less than order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the set_coefficients method correctly handles the case when the size of a_coeffs is less than the filter's order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared a_coeffs and valid b_coeffs.
  Assert: Verify that a_coeffs is correctly filled with a default value of 1.0 at the beginning and that no exceptions are thrown.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is important to ensure that the method correctly handles edge cases and follows the specified business logic.

Scenario 3: Test setting coefficients with a_coeffs size not equal to order+1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_incorrect_a_coeffs_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the set_coefficients method correctly raises a ValueError when the size of a_coeffs is not equal to order+1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size not equal to order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared a_coeffs and valid b_coeffs.
  Assert: Verify that a ValueError is raised with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is important to ensure that the method correctly handles invalid input and raises appropriate exceptions.

Scenario 4: Test setting coefficients with b_coeffs size not equal to order+1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_incorrect_b_coeffs_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the set_coefficients method correctly raises a ValueError when the size of b_coeffs is not equal to order+1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with valid a_coeffs and the prepared b_coeffs.
  Assert: Verify that a ValueError is raised with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is important to ensure that the method correctly handles invalid input and raises appropriate exceptions.
