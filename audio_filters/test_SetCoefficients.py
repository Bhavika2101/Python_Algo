================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The function set_coefficients accepts input parameters without performing any type of validation. If the function is exposed to an external interface, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code or data, leading to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Ensure to validate and sanitize all inputs to the function. Consider using Python's built-in isinstance function to check the data type of the inputs, and assert that the inputs meet your expected format.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependency (CWE-937)
Issue: The function set_coefficients relies on the scipy library. If an outdated or insecure version of this library is used, it could expose the application to various risks, including known vulnerabilities in the library.
Solution: Always use the latest and secure versions of all dependencies. Regularly check for updates and security patches of the scipy library and apply them as necessary. Consider using tools like PyUp or Dependabot for automated dependency updates.

```
Scenario 1: Valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs of correct length
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_valid_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly assigns the a_coeffs and b_coeffs if they are of correct length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with a given order. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the correct length.
  Act: Call the method set_coefficients with the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the IIRFilter object match the inputs.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly assigns the coefficients if the input is valid.

Scenario 2: a_coeffs shorter than the order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_short_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly prepends 1.0 to a_coeffs if it is shorter than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with a given order. Prepare a_coeffs shorter than the order and b_coeffs of the correct length.
  Act: Call the method set_coefficients with the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs of the IIRFilter object match the inputs with a prepended 1.0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles a_coeffs that are shorter than the order.

Scenario 3: a_coeffs longer than the order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_long_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises a ValueError if a_coeffs is longer than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with a given order. Prepare a_coeffs longer than the order and b_coeffs of the correct length.
  Act: Call the method set_coefficients with the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles a_coeffs that are longer than the order.

Scenario 4: b_coeffs shorter or longer than the order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_incorrect_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises a ValueError if b_coeffs is not of the correct length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with a given order. Prepare a_coeffs of the correct length and b_coeffs shorter or longer than the order.
  Act: Call the method set_coefficients with the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles b_coeffs that are not of the correct length.

Scenario 5: a_coeffs and b_coeffs of correct length but incorrect types
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_wrong_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises a TypeError if a_coeffs and b_coeffs are not lists of floats.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with a given order. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the correct length but incorrect types.
  Act: Call the method set_coefficients with the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check if a TypeError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles a_coeffs and b_coeffs of incorrect types.
