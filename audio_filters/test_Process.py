================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the type and value of 'sample', which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Add code to check the type and value of 'sample' before processing. If it is not a float or out of expected range, raise an exception or handle it appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The code does not check if the 'self.a_coeffs[0]' equals to zero before doing division, which can lead to a ZeroDivisionError.
Solution: Check if 'self.a_coeffs[0]' equals to zero before doing division. If it is zero, raise an exception or handle it appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The code is using array slicing to shift elements, which is not efficient for large lists and can lead to performance issues.
Solution: Consider using collections.deque, which is designed to have fast appends and pops from both ends. For example, 'self.input_history = collections.deque(self.input_history, maxlen=self.order+1)'.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the process function with zero sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_sample
  Description: This test will validate the process function's ability to handle a zero sample input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order of 2.
  Act: Call the process function with a zero sample.
  Assert: Verify that the result is zero.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle zero sample inputs as per its specifications.

Scenario 2: Validate the process function with a positive sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_sample
  Description: This test will validate the process function's ability to handle a positive sample input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order of 2.
  Act: Call the process function with a positive sample.
  Assert: Verify that the result is as expected based on the calculations performed by the function.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle positive sample inputs and return the correct result as per its specifications.

Scenario 3: Validate the process function with a negative sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_sample
  Description: This test will validate the process function's ability to handle a negative sample input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order of 2.
  Act: Call the process function with a negative sample.
  Assert: Verify that the result is as expected based on the calculations performed by the function.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle negative sample inputs and return the correct result as per its specifications.

Scenario 4: Validate the process function with a large sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_sample
  Description: This test will validate the process function's ability to handle a large sample input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order of 2.
  Act: Call the process function with a large sample.
  Assert: Verify that the result is as expected based on the calculations performed by the function.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle large sample inputs and return the correct result as per its specifications.

Scenario 5: Validate the process function with varying orders
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_varying_orders
  Description: This test will validate the process function's ability to handle varying orders.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with varying orders.
  Act: Call the process function with a sample.
  Assert: Verify that the result is as expected based on the calculations performed by the function.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle varying orders and return the correct result as per its specifications.
