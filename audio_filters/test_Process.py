================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the type and value of 'sample', which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Add code to check the type and value of 'sample' before processing. If it is not a float or out of expected range, raise an exception or handle it appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code assumes that 'self.b_coeffs' and 'self.a_coeffs' are always non-null, which may not be the case.
Solution: Add null checks for 'self.b_coeffs' and 'self.a_coeffs' before using them.

Vulnerability: CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
Issue: The code assumes that the length of 'self.b_coeffs', 'self.a_coeffs', 'self.input_history', and 'self.output_history' is always greater than 'self.order', which may not be the case.
Solution: Add code to check the lengths of 'self.b_coeffs', 'self.a_coeffs', 'self.input_history', and 'self.output_history' before accessing their elements with indices. If the lengths are not valid, raise an exception or handle it appropriately.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the process function with a zero sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_sample
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a zero sample input, as per the example provided in the function docstring.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the IIRFilter class with an order of 2.
  Act: Invoke the process function on the instance with a sample of 0.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 0.0, as per the example in the function docstring. This will be checked by comparing the function's return value to 0.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is crucial because it verifies that the function correctly handles a zero sample, which is a valid and likely input. The expected result of 0.0 is based on the function's specifications and the example provided in the function docstring.

Scenario 2: Testing the process function with a non-zero sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_non_zero_sample
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly calculates the result with a non-zero sample input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the IIRFilter class with an order of 2.
  Act: Invoke the process function on the instance with a non-zero sample.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a non-zero float, which will be checked by comparing the function's return value to the expected result.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is crucial because it verifies that the function correctly handles non-zero samples, which are likely inputs. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and the business logic encapsulated by the function.

Scenario 3: Testing the process function with negative sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_sample
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a negative sample input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the IIRFilter class with an order of 2.
  Act: Invoke the process function on the instance with a negative sample.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a float, which will be checked by comparing the function's return value to the expected result.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is crucial because it verifies that the function correctly handles negative samples, which are valid inputs. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and the business logic encapsulated by the function.

Scenario 4: Testing the process function with positive sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_sample
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a positive sample input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the IIRFilter class with an order of 2.
  Act: Invoke the process function on the instance with a positive sample.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a float, which will be checked by comparing the function's return value to the expected result.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is crucial because it verifies that the function correctly handles positive samples, which are likely inputs. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and the business logic encapsulated by the function.
