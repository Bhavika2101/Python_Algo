================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated User Input
Issue: The method 'process' accepts a parameter 'sample' which isn't validated or sanitized. This may lead to potential security vulnerabilities such as Injection attacks.
Solution: Always validate and/or sanitize user inputs. Use of sanitizers or specific data type parsers depending on the input can reduce the risk.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling
Issue: The code does not demonstrate any error handling. In the event of an error, system information could be leaked, leading to disclosure of sensitive information.
Solution: Use try-except blocks to properly handle errors and exceptions. Avoid showing raw exception data or system-specific error messages to the end users.

Vulnerability: Usage of Third Party Packages
Issue: Third party packages can have their own vulnerabilities, the usage of which isn't shown in the code snippet.
Solution: Always use the latest version of third party packages and modules. Regularly check for known vulnerabilities in the packages you use in your project.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when order of the IIRFilter is 0 and sample value is 0.
Details:
  TestName: test_process_order_zero_sample_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the process function when the order of IIRFilter is 0 and input sample value is 0. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter with order as 0.
  Act: Call the process function on the filter object with sample value as 0.
  Assert: The output should be 0.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as it verifies the function's behavior for a simple scenario where no history input and output exist.

Scenario 2: Test when order of the IIRFilter is 1, and sample value is non-zero.
Details:
  TestName: test_process_order_one_sample_non_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the process function when the order of IIRFilter is 1 and sample input has non-zero value, indicating a simple filtering operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter with order as 1. Setup input and output history values with non-zero values.
  Act: Call the process function on the filter object with sample value as non-zero.
  Assert: The output should be calculated based on the filter coefficients and history values.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as it checks the function's behavior when some weights of filtering are used, ensuring the correctness of the convolution operation.

Scenario 3: Test updating of the input and output history.
Details:
  TestName: test_process_history_update
  Description: This test is to verify that after processing, the input_history and output_history on the filter object are updated with the recent sample and result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter with non-zero order. Setup input and output history values.
  Act: Call the process function on the filter object with a sample value.
  Assert: Compare the first element of input_history and output_history on the filter object with sample and result after calling process.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Ensuring that the history values are updated correctly is crucial as they are used for computation in subsequent calls to process.

Scenario 4: Test when order of the IIRFilter is large.
Details:
  TestName: test_process_large_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function works correctly when the order of the filter is large (let's say 100), ensuring the function's robustness and correctness for complex models.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter with a large order and non-zero coefficient values.
  Act: Call the process function with a non-zero sample value.
  Assert: The expected value should match the result from the processing.
Validation:
  Rationalize: As the order of the IIR filter increases, the complexity of the computation also increases. It's important to verify the function's behavior under such complex scenario.  

Scenario 5: Test when the coefficients are 0.
Details:
  TestName: test_process_zero_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function works correctly when either a_coeffs or b_coeffs of the filter are 0. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter with coefficients as 0.
  Act: Call the process function with a non-zero sample value.
  Assert: In this case, the output should be 0 irrespective of the sample input.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The coefficients directly influence the output. Hence, it's vital to verify the function's behavior when the coefficients are 0.
  
Scenario 6: Test the divisor to be non-zero.
Details:
  TestName: test_process_non_zero_divisor
  Description: This test is intended to check if the process function executes without any division by zero error when a_coeffs[0] is 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter with a_coeffs[0] as 0.
  Act: Call the process function with a sample value.
  Assert: The function should raise division by zero error.
Validation:
  Rationalize: It's important to ensure appropriate error handling in the function to avoid bugs and crashes in the application.
