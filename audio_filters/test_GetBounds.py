================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function 'get_bounds' takes an array and a sample rate as inputs but does not validate these inputs. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the inputs are not as expected.
Solution: Add input validation to check the type and value of inputs before using them. For example, check that the sample rate is a positive integer and that the array is a numpy array.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function 'get_bounds' does not handle the case where the fft_results array is empty or the sample rate is zero. This could lead to a zero division error or an index error.
Solution: Add checks to handle these edge cases. For example, if the fft_results array is empty or the sample rate is zero, return a default value or raise an appropriate error.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The function 'get_bounds' uses the 'min' and 'max' functions with a list that contains a single value and the result of a numpy function. These functions can be slow with large arrays and could be used in a denial of service attack.
Solution: Use numpy's 'amin' and 'amax' functions instead of 'min' and 'max'. These functions are designed to work with numpy arrays and can be much faster.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing with Normal Input
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_normal_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly returns the bounds when provided with normal input.
Execution:
  Arrange: We prepare an fft_results array with a normal distribution of values within the range of -20 to 20 and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: We pass the fft_results array and the samplerate to the get_bounds function.
  Assert: We expect the function to return a tuple containing the lowest and highest values in the fft_results array.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function works as expected under normal conditions. The expected result is in line with the function's purpose of returning the bounds of the fft_results array.

Scenario 2: Testing with All Values in fft_results Greater than 20
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_all_values_greater_than_20
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles the case where all values in the fft_results array are greater than 20.
Execution:
  Arrange: We prepare an fft_results array where all values are greater than 20 and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: We pass the fft_results array and the samplerate to the get_bounds function.
  Assert: We expect the function to return a tuple containing the value 20 for the lowest bound and the maximum value in the fft_results array for the highest bound.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases. The expected result is in line with the function's design of returning a lowest bound of -20 or 20 if all values in the fft_results array are less than -20 or greater than 20, respectively.

Scenario 3: Testing with All Values in fft_results Less than -20
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_all_values_less_than_minus_20
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles the case where all values in the fft_results array are less than -20.
Execution:
  Arrange: We prepare an fft_results array where all values are less than -20 and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: We pass the fft_results array and the samplerate to the get_bounds function.
  Assert: We expect the function to return a tuple containing the value -20 for the lowest bound and the value 20 for the highest bound.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases. The expected result is in line with the function's design of returning a highest bound of 20 if all values in the fft_results array are less than -20.

Scenario 4: Testing with Empty fft_results Array
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_empty_array
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles the case where the fft_results array is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: We prepare an empty fft_results array and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: We pass the fft_results array and the samplerate to the get_bounds function.
  Assert: We expect the function to return a tuple containing the values -20 and 20 for the lowest and highest bounds, respectively.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases. The expected result is in line with the function's design of returning the bounds of -20 and 20 if the fft_results array is empty.
