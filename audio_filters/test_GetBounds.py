================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The function get_bounds() does not validate the input types for fft_results and samplerate. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the input is not as expected.
Solution: Validate the inputs to ensure they are of the expected types. For instance, check that fft_results is a numpy array and samplerate is an integer.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of min and max Functions
Issue: The min and max functions are used on a list that contains a single value and the result of a numpy function. This could raise a ValueError if the numpy function returns an empty sequence.
Solution: Ensure that the numpy function does not return an empty sequence before using min and max functions.

Vulnerability: Potential Division By Zero (CWE-369)
Issue: The function get_bounds() contains a division operation 'samplerate // 2 - 1' that could result in a division by zero error if the samplerate is 2.
Solution: Add a check to ensure that samplerate is not 2 before performing the division operation.

```
Scenario 1: Validate the output of the function when fft_results contains both negative and positive values.
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_mixed_values
  Description: This test aims to verify the correct calculation of the bounds when the fft_results array contains both negative and positive values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with both negative and positive values.
  Act: Call get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate.
  Assert: The function should return a tuple with the lowest and highest values from the array.
Validation:
  The test is crucial to confirm the function's ability to correctly calculate the bounds in a typical scenario where the fft_results array contains both negative and positive values.

Scenario 2: Validate the output of the function when fft_results contains all negative values.
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_all_negative_values
  Description: This test aims to verify the correct calculation of the bounds when the fft_results array contains all negative values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with all negative values.
  Act: Call get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate.
  Assert: The function should return a tuple with the lowest and highest values from the array.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function's ability to handle scenarios where all values in the fft_results array are negative.

Scenario 3: Validate the output of the function when fft_results contains all positive values.
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_all_positive_values
  Description: This test aims to verify the correct calculation of the bounds when the fft_results array contains all positive values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with all positive values.
  Act: Call get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate.
  Assert: The function should return a tuple with the lowest and highest values from the array.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function's ability to handle scenarios where all values in the fft_results array are positive.

Scenario 4: Validate the output of the function when fft_results is an empty array.
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_empty_array
  Description: This test aims to verify the function's behavior when the fft_results is an empty array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty array.
  Act: Call get_bounds function with the empty array and a sample rate.
  Assert: The function should return a tuple with the lowest and highest values as -20 and 20 respectively.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function's ability to handle scenarios where the fft_results array is empty.

Scenario 5: Validate the output of the function when the samplerate is zero.
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_zero_samplerate
  Description: This test aims to verify the function's behavior when the samplerate is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with some values.
  Act: Call get_bounds function with the array and samplerate as zero.
  Assert: The function should return a tuple with the lowest and highest values as -20 and 20 respectively.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function's ability to handle scenarios where the samplerate is zero.
