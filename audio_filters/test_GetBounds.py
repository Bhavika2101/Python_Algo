================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input validation
Issue: The code didn't implement any validations on the inputs which might lead to type errors or other runtime errors, also, it can create potential for unexpected behavior, if the inputs are not as expected.
Solution: Inputs should be validated before use. This could be as simple as checking if an input is of the expected type or more complicated as checking if an input meets certain criteria. For example, fft_results should be checked if it's an instance of np.ndarray by 'if isinstance(fft_results, np.ndarray):'

Vulnerability: Exception handling
Issue: The code didn't implement any exception handling which might lead to termination of the program in case of errors.
Solution: Appropriate exception handling should be implemented to prevent the termination of the program on unexpected inputs or other errors. For example, 'try: except:' block should be implemented around the code where exception might occur.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validating the boundary condition where the FFT result min and max are within the range -20 to 20
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_within_range
  Description: This test will check if the function is able to correctly determine the lower and upper bounds when the FFT result min and max are within the range -20 to 20.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with numpy.linspace to have min and max within the range -20 to 20 and samplerate as 1000.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function passing the prepared array as fft_results and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the returned bounds match the expected ones (-20, 20).
Validation:
  This checks the basic functionality of the function to determine bounds within the default range and is crucial to validate the proposed functionality.

Scenario 2: Validating the boundary condition where the FFT result min and max are outside the range -20 to 20
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_outside_range
  Description: This test will check if the function is able to correctly determine the lower and upper bounds when the FFT result min and max are outside the range -20 to 20.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with numpy.linspace to have min and max outside the range -20 to 20 and samplerate as 1000.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function passing the prepared array as fft_results and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the returned bounds match the expected ones (min of array, max of array).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly determines bounds outside the default range, proving its flexibility and adherence to the provided specifications.

Scenario 3: Validate when FFT results have all values below -20
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_all_below_lower_limit
  Description: This tests if the function correctly determines the bounds when all FFT results are below the lower limit of -20.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with numpy.linspace to have all values below -20 and samplerate as 1000.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function passing the prepared array as fft_results and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the returned bounds match -20 and the max from the array.
Validation:
  This validates the functionality of handling extreme conditions and ensuring the lower bound is provided as -20 when all FFT results are below this limit.

Scenario 4: Validate when FFT results have all values above 20
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_all_above_upper_limit
  Description: This tests if the function correctly determines the bounds when all FFT results are above the upper limit of 20.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with numpy.linspace to have all values above 20 and samplerate as 1000.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function passing the prepared array as fft_results and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the returned bounds match 20 and the max from the array.
Validation:
  This tests the function's ability to handle extreme conditions and ensuring the upper bound is provided as the max from the array when all FFT results are above this limit.

Scenario 5: Validate when FFT results array is empty
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_empty_array
  Description: This test will check if the function can handle an empty array gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty array and samplerate as 1000.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function passing the empty array as fft_results and samplerate.
  Assert: The test should possibly throw an error due to an empty array.
Validation:
  It's important to validate the ability of the solution to handle exceptional scenarios. Proper exception handling in such situations makes the function more robust and reliable.
