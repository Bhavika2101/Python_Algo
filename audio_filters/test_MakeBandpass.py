================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Imported Modules
Issue: The code imports the 'IIRFilter' class from 'audio_filters.iir_filter' package. If this package is not properly maintained or has security vulnerabilities, it could lead to security risks in this code as well.
Solution: Ensure that the 'audio_filters.iir_filter' package is up-to-date and maintained. If not, consider using alternatives or implement the 'IIRFilter' functionality directly in your code.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The function 'make_bandpass' accepts inputs but does not validate them. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if incorrect inputs are provided.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that 'frequency', 'samplerate', and 'q_factor' are of correct type and within expected range. Raise appropriate errors if invalid input is provided.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing make_bandpass with standard values
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_standard_values
  Description: This test verifies that the function make_bandpass works properly with standard values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function make_bandpass with frequency = 1000, samplerate = 48000, q_factor = 1/sqrt(2).
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's coefficients match the expected values as per the function's documentation.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function works correctly under normal conditions. The expected result is directly linked to the function's specification.

Scenario 2: Testing make_bandpass with zero frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_zero_frequency
  Description: This test verifies that the function make_bandpass handles the edge case of zero frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function make_bandpass with frequency = 0, samplerate = 48000, q_factor = 1/sqrt(2).
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's coefficients are correct for a zero frequency.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function can handle edge cases correctly. The expected result is based on the mathematical behavior of the function when the frequency is zero.

Scenario 3: Testing make_bandpass with frequency higher than samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_high_frequency
  Description: This test verifies that the function make_bandpass handles the edge case where the frequency is higher than the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function make_bandpass with frequency = 50000, samplerate = 48000, q_factor = 1/sqrt(2).
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's coefficients are correct for a frequency higher than the samplerate.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function can handle edge cases correctly. The expected result is based on the mathematical behavior of the function when the frequency is higher than the samplerate.

Scenario 4: Testing make_bandpass with negative q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_negative_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies that the function make_bandpass handles the edge case of a negative q_factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function make_bandpass with frequency = 1000, samplerate = 48000, q_factor = -1/sqrt(2).
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's coefficients are correct for a negative q_factor.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function can handle edge cases correctly. The expected result is based on the mathematical behavior of the function when the q_factor is negative.
