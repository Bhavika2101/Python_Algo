================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function get_bounds does not validate its inputs, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the inputs are not as expected. For instance, if fft_results is not an array or does not contain the expected values, or if samplerate is not an integer, the function could fail.
Solution: Add checks at the beginning of the function to ensure that fft_results is an ndarray, and that samplerate is an integer. Raise appropriate exceptions if these conditions are not met.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function get_bounds does not handle the case where fft_results has fewer than samplerate // 2 - 1 elements. In such a case, fft_results[1 : samplerate // 2 - 1] would be an empty array, and np.min and np.max would return NaN, which could lead to unexpected behavior later on.
Solution: Check the length of fft_results at the beginning of the function, and raise an exception if it has fewer than samplerate // 2 - 1 elements.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: The function get_bounds mixes ints and floats in an inconsistent manner. The return type is tuple[int | float, int | float], but the function uses np.min and np.max, which return floats, and then compares these to the int -20. This could lead to precision errors or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Ensure consistent use of numeric types. If the function should be able to handle both ints and floats, make sure to convert values to the appropriate type before comparing or returning them.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing with a normal range of values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_normal_range
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds of a normal range of values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the fft_results array with a regular range of values and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized fft_results array and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds match the expected ones.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the function works as expected with a normal range of values. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and the requirements of determining the bounds of the fft results.

Scenario 2: Testing with all values below the minimum bound
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_below_min
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when all fft results are below the minimum bound.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the fft_results array with all values below -20 and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized fft_results array and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds match the expected ones.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles cases where all fft results are below the minimum bound. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and the requirements of determining the bounds of the fft results.

Scenario 3: Testing with all values above the maximum bound
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_above_max
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when all fft results are above the maximum bound.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the fft_results array with all values above 20 and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized fft_results array and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds match the expected ones.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles cases where all fft results are above the maximum bound. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and the requirements of determining the bounds of the fft results.

Scenario 4: Testing with a mix of normal and out-of-bound values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_mixed_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when the fft results include a mix of normal and out-of-bound values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the fft_results array with a mix of values above 20, below -20, and in between, and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized fft_results array and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds match the expected ones.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles cases where the fft results include a mix of normal and out-of-bound values. The expected result is based on the function's specifications and the requirements of determining the bounds of the fft results.
