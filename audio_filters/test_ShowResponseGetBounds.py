================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The code does not handle potential integer overflow errors while performing calculations in the get_bounds function, which may lead to unexpected results.
Solution: Consider adding error handling or conditions to check for integer overflow situations. This can be done by checking if the resulting value is greater than the maximum allowed integer capacity or wrapped to a negative value.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: There is no check for NULL or None values before performing operations on the fft_results variable, which may lead to a NULL Pointer Dereference if fft_results does not contain valid data.
Solution: Consider adding a check at the start of the get_bounds function to check if fft_results is not None before performing further operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The numpy and matplotlib libraries can load data from files. There is no explicit restriction against loading and processing data from untrusted or unrestricted directories, which can lead to path traversal attacks.
Solution: Use secure programming practices when handling file paths, and take measures to prevent untrusted data from being processed where possible.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with generic random array
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_generic
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can accurately get the correct bounds from a generic random FFT results array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a random array of 1000 float numbers to simulate fft_results and use samplerate = 1000.
  Act: Invoke the function by passing the generated array and the samplerate.
  Assert: The returned lowest and highest should match the min and max values bounded by -20 and 20.
Validation:
  It is important to verify that the function works correctly with generic inputs, and ensure the efficiency and accuracy of the formula.

Scenario 2: Test with FFT results array contains values all greater than 20
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_values_greater_than_20
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function behaves correctly when all fft_results are greater than 20.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Construct an array with all values greater than 20 and use samplerate = 1000.
  Act: Invoke the function by inputting the constructed array and samplerate.
  Assert: The returned highest should be the maximum value in the array and the lowest should be 20.
Validation:
  This test helps to ensure the method accurately applies its internal bounds of -20 and 20 to the results properly when the array values are beyond the boundary.

Scenario 3: Test with FFT results array contains values all less than -20
Details: 
  TestName: test_get_bounds_values_less_than_minus_20
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function behaves correctly when all fft_results are less than -20.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Construct an array with all values less than -20 and use samplerate = 1000.
  Act: Invoke the function by inputting the constructed array and samplerate.
  Assert: The returned lowest should be -20, and the highest returned value should be the maximum value in the fft_results array.
Validation:
  This scenario validates that the method works correctly when the fft_results array contains values less than the lower boundary value (-20) specified inside the method.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty FFT results array
Details: 
  TestName: test_get_bounds_empty_array
  Description: This test is meant to validate the edge case when the fft_results array is empty.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Construct an empty array and use samplerate = 1000.
  Act: Invoke the function by passing the empty array and samplerate.
  Assert: The function should raise an error for invalid input.
Validation:
  Validates that the function has proper error handling for empty fft_results. This is an important boundary condition for this method.

Scenario 5: Test with a very large samplerate
Details: 
  TestName: test_get_bounds_large_samplerate
  Description: This test is to check the behavior of the function when provided with a very large samplerate.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create an fft_results array of 1000 elements and use a very large samplerate, like 10000.
  Act: Call the function with the prepared fft_results and large samplerate.
  Assert: The function should return the correct bounds, with proper handling of the large samplerate.
Validation:
  This scenario checks how this function handles the situation when a very large samplerate is passed, ensuring it can handle a larger range of inputs.
