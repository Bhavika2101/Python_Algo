================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The function get_bounds does not validate or sanitize the input it receives. An attacker could potentially provide malicious input to the function, leading to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Incorporate checks to validate the input. This could involve checking the type of the input, its length, and ensuring it does not contain any unexpected values.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The function get_bounds directly exposes the system's internal workings (fft_results, samplerate) without any form of obfuscation or security check. This could provide valuable information to an attacker, aiding in system exploitation.
Solution: Consider obfuscating system details or implementing additional security measures to prevent direct access to system internals.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Third-Party Libraries
Issue: The code imports several third-party libraries (matplotlib.pyplot, numpy) without any checks for their security or authenticity. These libraries could potentially contain malicious code.
Solution: Always use trusted sources for third-party libraries, regularly update them to the latest version, and perform security checks on the libraries before use.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing with Normal FFT Results
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_normal_fft_results
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly get the bounds of the FFT results within the normal range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a numpy array with values ranging from -10 to 10 and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized numpy array and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the returned bounds are (-10, 10).
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function can handle normal FFT results. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications which state that it should return the bounds of the FFT results.

Scenario 2: Testing with FFT Results All Below -20
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_fft_results_all_below_minus_20
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly get the bounds of the FFT results when all values are below -20.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a numpy array with values ranging from -30 to -21 and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized numpy array and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the returned bounds are (-20, -21).
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function can handle FFT results that are all below -20. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications which state that it should return the bounds of the FFT results.

Scenario 3: Testing with FFT Results All Above 20
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_fft_results_all_above_20
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly get the bounds of the FFT results when all values are above 20.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a numpy array with values ranging from 21 to 30 and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized numpy array and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the returned bounds are (21, 20).
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function can handle FFT results that are all above 20. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications which state that it should return the bounds of the FFT results.

Scenario 4: Testing with FFT Results Having Only One Value 
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_fft_results_having_only_one_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly get the bounds of the FFT results when the array has only one value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a numpy array with only one value 0 and a samplerate of 1000.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized numpy array and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the returned bounds are (-20, 20).
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function can handle FFT results that have only one value. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications which state that it should return the bounds of the FFT results.
