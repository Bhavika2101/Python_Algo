================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: This Python code lacks any user authentication. As such, any user could run this code and potentially use it in a manner not intended by the author.
Solution: Implement some form of user authentication. Depending on requirements and threat model, this could be as simple as a check for user identify via an API token.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The code is directly importing several Python libraries. An attacker could manipulate these libraries at a file level before they are imported, leading to potential execution of malicious code.
Solution: Runtime controls should be implemented to ensure the integrity of imported libraries. Also, the application could be designed to fail securely if library integrity checks fail.

Vulnerability: CWE-282: Improper Ownership Management
Issue: The code could be run with higher privileges or lower restrictions than intended due to lack of explicit permission definitions. This can lead to elevated risk if the code execution environment is compromised.
Solution: Explicitly define user and group ownership for the code files. For execution permission and access control, follow the principle of least privilege.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: No encryption or hashing algorithms are used in this code. This makes data accessible in plaintext, creating a privacy and confidentiality risk.
Solution: Where required, integrate secure cryptographic functionalities for data protection. Use strong, non-deprecated cryptographic algorithms and libraries.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the output of get_bounds with an fft_results array where max value is higher than 20 
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_max_value_greater_than_20
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function is correctly getting the maximum and minimum bounds when max value of fft_results array is higher than 20.
Execution:
  Arrange: An fft_results array will be created where values will be positive, and maximum of which will be greater than 20.
  Act: The get_bounds function is invoked with the fft_results array and a defined samplerate.
  Assert: The expected outcome would be a tuple (lowest, highest), where highest is equal to max value of the fft_results array.
Validation:
  This is an important test because it verifies the correct behavior of the get_bounds function for valid scenarios where maximum values in the input array are greater than 20.

Scenario 2: Validate the output of get_bounds with an fft_results array where min value is lower than -20 
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_min_value_less_than_minus_20
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function is correctly getting the maximum and minimum bounds when min value of fft_results array is lower than -20.
Execution:
  Arrange: An fft_results array will be created where values will be negative, and minimum of which will be lower than -20.
  Act: The get_bounds function is invoked with the fft_results array and a defined samplerate.
  Assert: The expected outcome would be a tuple (lowest, highest), where lowest is equal to min value of the fft_results array.
Validation:
  This is an important test because it verifies the correct behavior of the get_bounds function for valid scenarios where minimum values in the input array are lower than -20.

Scenario 3: Validate the behavior of get_bounds when fft_results array is empty.
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_empty_fft_results
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when fft_results is an empty array.
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty fft_results array will be used.
  Act: The get_bounds function is invoked with the empty fft_results array and a defined samplerate.
  Assert: An appropriate exception should be thrown, since there should be no minimum and maximum in an empty array.
Validation:
  This test scenario is crucial to ensure that the function can appropriately handle edge cases and error conditions, maintaining its robustness and reliability.

Scenario 4: Validate get_bounds function with fft_results having all values present between -20 and 20
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_values_between_minus_20_and_20
  Description: This test is intended to confirm that the get_bounds function is returning correct bounds when all fft_results are between -20 and 20.
Execution:
  Arrange: fft_results array with all values between -20 and 20
  Act: The get_bounds function is invoked with the fft_results array and a defined samplerate.
  Assert: The expected outcome should be a tuple (-20, 20), as it is in the hard coded range of the get_bounds function.
Validation:
  This scenario allows the function's generic behavior validation with inputs not having outliers. This is beneficial in the most common circumstances and defining function's basic behaviour.
