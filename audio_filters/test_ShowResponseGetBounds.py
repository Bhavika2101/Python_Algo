================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function get_bounds does not validate its inputs. If fft_results is not an array or if its size is less than samplerate // 2 - 1, the function may crash or behave unexpectedly.
Solution: Add checks at the start of the function to ensure that fft_results is an array and that its size is at least samplerate // 2 - 1. If these conditions are not met, raise an exception or return a suitable error value.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function get_bounds does not handle the case where samplerate is less than 2. If this happens, samplerate // 2 - 1 will be 0, and the function will crash when it attempts to access fft_results[1 : 0].
Solution: Add a check at the start of the function to ensure that samplerate is at least 2. If this condition is not met, raise an exception or return a suitable error value.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The function get_bounds uses min and max functions on potentially large arrays, which might lead to memory overflow or slow performance if the arrays are too large.
Solution: Consider using numpy's built-in functions np.min and np.max, which are more efficient and safer for large arrays.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing with a normal range of values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_normal_range
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds of a normal range of values as defined by the Fast Fourier Transform results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using numpy.linspace with values ranging from -20.0 to 20.0.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds are (-20, 20).
Validation:
  This test is important as it validates that the function correctly identifies the bounds of a standard range of values, which is a key aspect of its business logic.

Scenario 2: Testing with all positive values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_all_positive
  Description: This test verifies that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when all values in the fft_results array are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using numpy.linspace with values ranging from 0.0 to 40.0.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds are (0, 40).
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function's ability to handle scenarios where all values are positive, which could be a common occurrence in real-world data.

Scenario 3: Testing with all negative values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_all_negative
  Description: This test verifies that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when all values in the fft_results array are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using numpy.linspace with values ranging from -40.0 to -20.0.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds are (-40, -20).
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function's ability to handle scenarios where all values are negative, ensuring the function's robustness and validity for varied input data.

Scenario 4: Testing with zero as the only value
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_zero_only
  Description: This test verifies that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when zero is the only value in the fft_results array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using numpy.linspace with a single value of 0.0.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds are (0, 0).
Validation:
  This test is important as it tests the function's ability to handle edge cases where the input data consists of a single value, ensuring its robustness and validity.

Scenario 5: Testing with a single positive value
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_single_positive
  Description: This test verifies that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when there is a single positive value in the fft_results array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using numpy.linspace with a single value of 20.0.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds are (20, 20).
Validation:
  This test is important as it tests the function's ability to handle edge cases where the input data consists of a single value, ensuring its robustness and validity.

Scenario 6: Testing with a single negative value
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_single_negative
  Description: This test verifies that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when there is a single negative value in the fft_results array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using numpy.linspace with a single value of -20.0.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds are (-20, -20).
Validation:
  This test is important as it tests the function's ability to handle edge cases where the input data consists of a single value, ensuring its robustness and validity.
