================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)
Issue: The function get_bounds processes fft_results array without validating its size. If a large array is provided, it may lead to high memory usage and slow processing speed, which can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Implement a size check for fft_results array before processing it. If the size is too large, raise an exception or handle it appropriately.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Python's Standard Library (CWE-676)
Issue: The function get_bounds uses the min and max functions on potentially large sections of the fft_results array. These functions are not designed to handle large data sets and can lead to memory issues.
Solution: Consider using numpy's inbuilt functions, np.min and np.max, as these are designed for large numpy arrays and are more efficient and less prone to memory issues.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependency Management (CWE-937)
Issue: The code imports third-party packages numpy and matplotlib.pyplot without checking the versions. The imported packages may have known vulnerabilities if not updated to their latest versions.
Solution: Ensure that the numpy and matplotlib.pyplot packages are updated to their latest versions. Consider using a package manager, like pip, that can automatically handle updates and check for known security vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing with positive fft_results and samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_positive_fft_results_and_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the get_bounds function's ability to correctly calculate the lowest and highest bounds when provided with a positive fft_results array and samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive fft_results array and a positive samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized fft_results and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the returned lowest and highest bounds are as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle typical use cases where both the fft_results and the samplerate are positive.

Scenario 2: Testing with negative fft_results and positive samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_negative_fft_results_and_positive_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the get_bounds function's ability to correctly calculate the lowest and highest bounds when provided with a negative fft_results array and a positive samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a negative fft_results array and a positive samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized fft_results and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the returned lowest and highest bounds are as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle cases where the fft_results are negative.

Scenario 3: Testing with zero samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_zero_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the get_bounds function's behavior when provided with a zero samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a fft_results array and a samplerate of zero.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized fft_results and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the function raises a ZeroDivisionError.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle edge cases where the samplerate is zero.

Scenario 4: Testing with empty fft_results array and positive samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_with_empty_fft_results_and_positive_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the get_bounds function's behavior when provided with an empty fft_results array and a positive samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty fft_results array and a positive samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized fft_results and samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the function returns (-20, 20) as the lowest and highest bounds.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle edge cases where the fft_results array is empty.
