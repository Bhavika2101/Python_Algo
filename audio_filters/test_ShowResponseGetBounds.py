================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)
Issue: The code takes a slice of the fft_results array based on the samplerate value without checking if the samplerate is within the length of the fft_results array. This can lead to an out of bounds error or undesired results.
Solution: Implement a check to ensure that the samplerate is within the bounds of the fft_results array length.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (CWE-639)
Issue: The code directly accesses elements from the fft_results array using indices without validating the contents of the array. If the array contains malicious data or is manipulated, it can lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Validate the contents of the fft_results array before accessing its elements.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling (CWE-703)
Issue: The code does not handle potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of the function. This can lead to program crashes or unhandled exceptions, which can be exploited by attackers.
Solution: Implement error handling or exception handling mechanisms to catch and handle potential errors or exceptions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing with a normal range of values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_normal_range
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds of a normal range of values as defined by the Fast Fourier Transform results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using numpy.linspace with values ranging from -20.0 to 20.0.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds are (-20, 20).
Validation:
  This test is important as it validates that the function correctly identifies the bounds of a standard range of values, which is a key aspect of its business logic.

Scenario 2: Testing with all positive values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_all_positive
  Description: This test verifies that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when all values in the fft_results array are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using numpy.linspace with values ranging from 0.0 to 40.0.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds are (0, 40).
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function's ability to handle scenarios where all values are positive, which could be a common occurrence in real-world data.

Scenario 3: Testing with all negative values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_all_negative
  Description: This test verifies that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when all values in the fft_results array are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using numpy.linspace with values ranging from -40.0 to -20.0.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds are (-40, -20).
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function's ability to handle scenarios where all values are negative, ensuring the function's robustness and validity for varied input data.

Scenario 4: Testing with zero as the only value
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_zero_only
  Description: This test verifies that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when zero is the only value in the fft_results array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using numpy.zeros to create an array of zeros.
  Act: Invoke the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned bounds are (0, 0).
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function's ability to handle scenarios where zero is the only value, ensuring the function's robustness and validity for varied input data.
