================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)
Issue: The code takes a slice of the fft_results array based on the samplerate value without checking if the samplerate is within the length of the fft_results array. This can lead to an out-of-bound error or undesired results.
Solution: Implement a check to ensure that the samplerate is within the bounds of the fft_results array length.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (CWE-639)
Issue: The code directly accesses elements from the fft_results array using indices without validating the contents of the array. If the array contains malicious data or is manipulated in any way, it could lead to potential security risks.
Solution: Validate the contents of the fft_results array before accessing it.

Vulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321)
Issue: The code uses hard-coded values of -20 and 20 when determining the lowest and highest bounds. If these values are used for any sensitive computations, it could lead to potential security risks.
Solution: Avoid using hard-coded values. Instead, use a secure method to generate or retrieve these values.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing with a normal range of values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_normal_range
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds of a normal range of values as defined by the Fast Fourier Transform results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using np.linspace with values ranging from -20 to 20.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple matches the expected lowest and highest values of the array.
Validation:
  This test is important as it validates that the function correctly identifies the bounds of a standard range of values, which is a key aspect of its business logic.

Scenario 2: Testing with all positive values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_all_positive
  Description: This test verifies that the get_bounds function correctly determines the bounds when all values in the fft_results array are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using np.linspace with values ranging from 0 to 40.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple matches the expected lowest and highest values of the array.
Validation:
  This test is necessary to ensure that the function can correctly handle scenarios where all values are positive, which is a possible real-world scenario.

Scenario 3: Testing with all negative values
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_all_negative
  Description: This test verifies that the get_bounds function correctly identifies the bounds when all values in the fft_results array are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using np.linspace with values ranging from -40 to -20.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple matches the expected lowest and highest values of the array.
Validation:
  This test is critical to ensure that the function can accurately identify the bounds in scenarios where all values are negative, which is a possible real-world scenario.

Scenario 4: Testing with fft_results array containing only one unique value
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_one_unique_value
  Description: This test verifies that the get_bounds function correctly identifies the bounds when the fft_results array contains only one unique value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using np.linspace with only one unique value.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple matches the expected lowest and highest values of the array.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle scenarios where the fft_results array contains only one unique value, which is a possible real-world scenario.

Scenario 5: Testing with a large sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_get_bounds_large_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_bounds function correctly identifies the bounds when provided with a large sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array using np.linspace with values ranging from -20 to 20.
  Act: Call the get_bounds function with the initialized array and a sample rate of 1000000.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple matches the expected lowest and highest values of the array.
Validation:
  This test is critical to ensure that the function can handle scenarios where the sample rate is large, which may occur in real-world scenarios.
