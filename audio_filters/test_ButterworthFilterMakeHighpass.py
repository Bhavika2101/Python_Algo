================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Incorrect Use of External Library
Issue: The code utilizes the 'IIRFilter' class from the 'audio_filters.iir_filter' library, but there is no validation or error handling for the parameters passed to the 'set_coefficients' method. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or crash the program if incorrect parameters are used.
Solution: Implement proper validation for the 'set_coefficients' method parameters. If possible, also implement error handling to recover gracefully from potential issues.

Vulnerability: Arithmetic Overflow or Underflow (CWE-190)
Issue: The code does not handle potential arithmetic overflow or underflow in expressions where mathematical operations are performed. This lack of handling could lead to unexpected behavior or crash the program.
Solution: Circumvent this issue by implementing a check before performing the mathematical operations to ensure that operands are within an acceptable range that will not cause overflow or underflow.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test high-pass filter creation with default Q factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_default_q
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct creation of a high-pass filter when no Q factor is passed to the function, defaulting to 1 / sqrt(2).
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function is stateless.
  Act: Call make_highpass with valid frequency and samplerate, without passing a Q factor.
  Assert: Check that an IIRFilter object is returned and its coefficients are correct.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function behaves correctly under normal parameters and defaults. Returned coefficients are expected to match the example in function's docstring if the same values are used.

Scenario 2: Test high-pass filter creation with specific Q factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_specific_q
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct creation of a high-pass filter when a specific Q factor is passed to the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function is stateless.
  Act: Call make_highpass with valid frequency, samplerate, and a specific Q factor.
  Assert: Check that an IIRFilter object is returned and its coefficients match the expectation.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function applies the given Q factor correctly. For this, we would expect variations in the coefficients versus the default Q factor.

Scenario 3: Test high-pass filter creation with frequency equals to zero.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_frequency_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-pass filter behaves as expected when a frequency of zero is passed in.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function is stateless.
  Act: Call make_highpass with frequency set to zero, and a valid samplerate.
  Assert: Check that an IIRFilter object is returned and its coefficients match the expectation.
Validation:
  This test is important because we need to ensure that the filter can handle edge cases such as a zero frequency value. 

Scenario 4: Test high-pass filter creation with high frequency.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_high_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles frequencies that approach or exceed the Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate).
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function is stateless.
  Act: Call make_highpass with a frequency that is close to the Nyquist frequency, and a valid samplerate.
  Assert: Check that an IIRFilter object is returned and its coefficients match the expectation.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly handles edge cases of high frequencies. It is important for ensuring the filter's stability and effectiveness in real-world applications.

Note: 
The actual values to be used for frequencies and sample rates can be determined during the test code creation phase.
