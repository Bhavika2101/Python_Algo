================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated input
Issue: The function parameters are not being validated. If this function were to be exposed to a broader system or via an API, it could accept potentially harmful values.
Solution: Ensure to validate all input to the function for type, format, and range.

Vulnerability: Dependency on third-party packages
Issue: The code seems to rely on a third-party package 'audio_filters'. If the third-party package has vulnerabilities, it may expose the code to threats.
Solution: Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and free from known security vulnerabilities. Regularly monitor the security advisories for the dependencies.

Vulnerability: Insecure Exception Handling
Issue: There doesn't seem to be any exception handling in the code. The absence of exception handling could make the application crash when encountering unexpected inputs or conditions.
Solution: Implement exception handling to handle any potential errors or exceptions. This will make the application more robust and secure.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verification of Normal High-Pass Filter Creation
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_nominal
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the make_highpass function can correctly create a high-pass filter with nominal parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required as the input parameters are passed directly to the function.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with a frequency of 1000, a samplerate of 48000, and the default q_factor.
  Assert: Check that the resulting filter has the expected 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' values.
Validation:
  The input parameters are within the expected range for a real-world application, ensuring the ability of the function to create a high-pass filter using nominal parameters.

Scenario 2: Exceptional Q-Factor Values 
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_edge_qfactors
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the make_highpass function can correctly create high-pass filters with edge values for the q_factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required as the input parameters are passed directly to the function.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with a frequency of 1000, a samplerate of 48000 and edge q_factor values (e.g., minimum and maximum).
  Assert: Check that the resulting filter has 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' values within the expected range for high-pass filters given the q_factor.
Validation:
  The q_factor could be an edge value in real-world scenarios. Testing the function with these parameters ensures the robustness of the function under edge conditions.

Scenario 3: Exceptional Frequency Values 
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_edge_frequencies
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the make_highpass function can correctly create high-pass filters with edge values for the frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required as the input parameters are passed directly to the function.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with edge frequency values (e.g., minimum and maximum), a samplerate of 48000, and the default q_factor.
  Assert: Check that the resulting filter has 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' values within the expected range for high-pass filters given the frequency.
Validation:
  Edge frequency values can also occur in real scenarios, and the function must handle these values efficiently, ensuring its stability under varying conditions.

Scenario 4: Zero Frequency Values
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_zero_frequency
  Description: This test is meant to ascertain how the function behaves with a frequency value of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement is necessary as the input parameters are provided directly.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with a frequency of zero, a samplerate of 48000, and the default q_factor.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' for a frequency of zero.
Validation:
  While a zero frequency might not be common in real-world applications, the function should handle it correctly, contributing to the robustness of the function.
