================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The function 'make_highpass' does not validate the input parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if incorrect values are passed.
Solution: Check the input parameters for validity. For example, 'frequency' and 'samplerate' should be positive integers, and 'q_factor' should be a positive float.

Vulnerability: Dependency Security
Issue: The code relies on a third-party package 'audio_filters'. If this package has vulnerabilities or is not maintained, it can expose the application to risks.
Solution: Ensure 'audio_filters' package is up-to-date and maintained. If possible, review its source code for any potential vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate High-pass Filter Coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_filter_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-pass filter is correctly created with the expected coefficients based on the input parameters. This ensures that the filter will behave as expected when applied to audio data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input parameters, such as frequency, samplerate, and q_factor.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the resulting filter has coefficients that match the expected values based on the input parameters.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important because the coefficients of the filter determine its behavior. If the coefficients are not correct, the filter will not produce the expected results when applied to audio data.

Scenario 2: Validate High-pass Filter with Default Q-factor
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_filter_default_qfactor
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-pass filter is correctly created when the q_factor is not specified. The default q_factor should be used in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input parameters, such as frequency and samplerate.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the resulting filter has coefficients that match the expected values based on the input parameters and the default q_factor.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important because it verifies that the function correctly handles default parameters. If the function does not correctly use the default q_factor when it is not specified, the resulting filter may not behave as expected.

Scenario 3: Validate High-pass Filter with Maximum Frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_filter_maximum_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-pass filter is correctly created when the maximum possible frequency is specified. This is an edge case that tests the function's ability to handle extreme input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input parameters, such as the maximum frequency and a samplerate.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the resulting filter has coefficients that match the expected values based on the input parameters.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important because it verifies that the function can handle extreme input values. If the function cannot correctly create a filter with the maximum frequency, it may not be able to handle other extreme input values as well.

Scenario 4: Validate High-pass Filter with Minimum Frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_filter_minimum_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-pass filter is correctly created when the minimum possible frequency (0) is specified. This is another edge case that tests the function's ability to handle extreme input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input parameters, such as the minimum frequency and a samplerate.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the resulting filter has coefficients that match the expected values based on the input parameters.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important because it verifies that the function can handle extreme input values. If the function cannot correctly create a filter with the minimum frequency, it may not be able to handle other extreme input values as well.
