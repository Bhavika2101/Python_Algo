================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The function 'make_highpass' does not validate the input parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if incorrect values are passed.
Solution: Check the input parameters for validity. For example, ensure the 'frequency' and 'samplerate' are positive integers, and 'q_factor' is a positive float.

Vulnerability: Dependency Security
Issue: The code relies on a third-party package 'audio_filters'. If this package has vulnerabilities or is not maintained, it can expose the application to risks.
Solution: Ensure 'audio_filters' package is up-to-date and maintained by a reputable source. Consider alternatives if the package is deprecated or unmaintained.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate High-pass Filter Coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_filter_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-pass filter is correctly created with the expected coefficients based on the input parameters. This ensures that the filter will behave as expected when applied to audio data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize frequency, samplerate, and q_factor with known values.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the filter is correctly configured based on the input parameters. This is crucial because incorrect coefficients could drastically distort the audio data.

Scenario 2: Validate High-pass Filter for Different Frequencies
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_different_frequencies
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-pass filter behaves differently for different frequencies. This is fundamental to the function of a high-pass filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize samplerate and q_factor with known values. Choose two different frequency values.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the different frequency values but the same samplerate and q_factor.
  Assert: Check that the filters' coefficients are different.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the high-pass filter behaves differently for different frequencies. This is crucial because a high-pass filter should only allow frequencies above a certain threshold to pass.

Scenario 3: Validate High-pass Filter for Different Q Factors
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_different_q_factors
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-pass filter behaves differently for different q factors. The q factor controls the sharpness of the filter's cutoff.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize frequency and samplerate with known values. Choose two different q_factor values.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the different q_factor values but the same frequency and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the filters' coefficients are different.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the high-pass filter behaves differently for different q factors. This is crucial because the q factor controls the sharpness of the filter's cutoff.

Scenario 4: Validate High-pass Filter for Different Samplerates
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_different_samplerates
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-pass filter behaves differently for different samplerates. The samplerate affects the range of frequencies that can be represented.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize frequency and q_factor with known values. Choose two different samplerate values.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the different samplerate values but the same frequency and q_factor.
  Assert: Check that the filters' coefficients are different.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the high-pass filter behaves differently for different samplerates. This is crucial because the samplerate affects the range of frequencies that can be represented.
