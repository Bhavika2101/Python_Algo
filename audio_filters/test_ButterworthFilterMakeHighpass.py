================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The function make_highpass does not check if the input parameters are of correct types and within the expected ranges. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Add input validation checks at the start of the function to ensure that 'frequency' and 'samplerate' are integers, 'q_factor' is a float, and all are within expected ranges.

Vulnerability: Uncaught exceptions (CWE-248)
Issue: If the input parameters cause any of the mathematical operations to fail, an exception will be raised which is not caught within the function. This can lead to the application crashing if not handled.
Solution: Add try/except blocks around the mathematical operations to catch and handle potential exceptions.

Vulnerability: Dependency security (CWE-937)
Issue: The code relies on a third-party module 'audio_filters.iir_filter'. If this module has any security vulnerabilities, they could affect this application as well.
Solution: Regularly update the 'audio_filters.iir_filter' module to the latest version, and monitor for any security advisories related to it. Consider using a dependency checking tool to automate this process.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the creation of a high-pass filter with default q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_with_default_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highpass function creates an IIRFilter object with the correct coefficients when the q_factor is not explicitly specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required as we are not using any external dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with frequency and samplerate as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and its coefficients match the expected values.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly handles the default value of q_factor and creates the appropriate IIRFilter. This is important for the function's primary use case.

Scenario 2: Validate the creation of a high-pass filter with a specific q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_with_specific_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highpass function creates an IIRFilter object with the correct coefficients when a specific q_factor is given.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required as we are not using any external dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with frequency, samplerate, and a specific q_factor as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and its coefficients match the expected values.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly handles a provided q_factor and creates the appropriate IIRFilter. This is important for customizing the filter's behavior.

Scenario 3: Validate the creation of a high-pass filter with a frequency equal to the samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_frequency_equals_samplerate
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highpass function creates an IIRFilter object with the correct coefficients when the frequency is equal to the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required as we are not using any external dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with frequency and samplerate being the same value.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and its coefficients match the expected values.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case where frequency equals samplerate. This is important for ensuring the filter's correct behavior in this special circumstance.

Scenario 4: Validate the creation of a high-pass filter with a frequency greater than the samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_frequency_greater_than_samplerate
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the make_highpass function when the frequency is greater than the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required as we are not using any external dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with frequency greater than samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and its coefficients match the expected values.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case where frequency is greater than samplerate. This is important for ensuring the filter's correct behavior in this special circumstance.
