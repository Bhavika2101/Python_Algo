================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: None
Solution: The code appears to be secure without typical exploitable security vulnerabilities

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Integer Frequency and Sample Rate
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_frequency_and_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the make_highpass function works correctly with valid parameters. It checks for frequency and sample rate values that are positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required in this case.
  Act: Invoke the function with valid inputs e.g., frequency of 1000 and sample rate of 48000.
  Assert: Check that the function returns an IIRFilter instance and the coefficients returned match the expected values.
Validation:
  It is important to validate that the function behaves as expected when provided with valid integer input values. This is the primary use case for the function.

Scenario 2: Test for Low Frequency Value
Details:
  TestName: test_low_frequency_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the make_highpass function handles low frequency values accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required in this scenario.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with a low frequency value (e.g., frequency=0) and a standard samplerate (e.g., 48000).
  Assert: Check that the function returns an IIRFilter instance and the coefficients returned match the expected values.
Validation:
  It is essential to verify that the function can handle lower limit frequency values accurately as it might be a possible user input.

Scenario 3: Test for High Frequency Value
Details:
  TestName: test_high_frequency_value
  Description: This test is intended to confirm that the function can accurately handle frequencies much higher than the sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the function with a high frequency value (e.g., frequency=96000) and a standard samplerate (e.g., 48000).
  Assert: Check that the function returns an IIRFilter instance and the coefficients returned match the expected values.
Validation:
  Validating the program's behavior with varying frequency inputs is crucial, especially when dealing with high-frequency inputs. The audio filters should be adaptive to handle this scenario correctly.

Scenario 4: Testing with different q_factors
Details:
  TestName: test_varying_q_factor
  Description: This test is inteded to check how the function behaves when the q_factor parameter varies.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the function multiple times with different q_factor values (e.g., 0.5, 1, 1.5).
  Assert: Check that the function returns IIRFilter instances and the coefficients returned match the expected values.
Validation:
  q_factor is a meaningful parameter in audio filters, meant to determine the selectivity of a filter. It's important to validate that the make_highpass function behaves accurately with different q_factor values. 

Scenario 5: Test for Zero Sample Rate
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_sample_rate
  Description: This test intends to verify how the function deals with a zero sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with a legitimate frequency but with a sample rate of zero.
  Assert: Check for an expected exception or error.
Validation:
  Sample rate should never be zero as this essentially means no audio is being processed. Therefore, the function must be equipped to handle such an error and fail gracefully.
