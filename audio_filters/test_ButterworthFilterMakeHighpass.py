ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=make_highpass_82938f5d7d

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The function make_highpass does not validate its input. If the frequency or samplerate is zero or negative, it can lead to division by zero error or unexpected results.
Solution: Add checks to validate that frequency and samplerate are greater than zero.

Vulnerability: Third-party library vulnerabilities (CWE-937)
Issue: The code uses the third-party package 'audio_filters'. Any vulnerabilities in this package could be exploited.
Solution: Keep the 'audio_filters' package up-to-date and monitor for any security vulnerabilities related to this package.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Highpass Filter Coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_filter_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-pass filter coefficients are calculated correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, and q_factor.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the output filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs are as expected.
Validation:
  Rational: This test is important as it checks the correctness of the filter creation process. The expected result is based on the mathematical formulas used in the function.

Scenario 2: Test for Zero Frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_zero_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highpass function when the frequency is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency to zero, and set samplerate and q_factor to arbitrary positive values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the output filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs are as expected.
Validation:
  Rational: This test is important as it checks the edge case where the frequency is zero. The expected result is based on the mathematical formulas used in the function.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Q Factor
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_negative_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highpass function when the q_factor is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the q_factor to a negative value, and set frequency and samplerate to arbitrary positive values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the output filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs are as expected.
Validation:
  Rational: This test is important as it checks the edge case where the q_factor is negative. The expected result is based on the mathematical formulas used in the function.

Scenario 4: Test for Zero Sample Rate
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_zero_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highpass function when the samplerate is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the samplerate to zero, and set frequency and q_factor to arbitrary positive values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the output filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs are as expected.
Validation:
  Rational: This test is important as it checks the edge case where the samplerate is zero. The expected result is based on the mathematical formulas used in the function.

Scenario 5: Test for Large Frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_large_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highpass function when the frequency is significantly large.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency to a large value, and set samplerate and q_factor to arbitrary positive values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the output filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs are as expected.
Validation:
  Rational: This test is important as it checks the edge case where the frequency is significantly large. The expected result is based on the mathematical formulas used in the function.
