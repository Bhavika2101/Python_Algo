================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)
Issue: The code does not limit the size of the 'samplerate' input, which could lead to excessive memory usage if a large integer is provided. This can cause the program to slow down or crash, affecting availability.
Solution: Add checks to limit the size of the 'samplerate' input. This could be a simple range check (e.g., 1 <= samplerate <= 1000000).

Vulnerability: Exposure of System Data (CWE-200)
Issue: The use of 'matplotlib.pyplot.show()' function can expose system-level details in the event of an error or exception. An attacker can exploit this to gain information about the system, which can be used for further attacks.
Solution: Handle exceptions that may be thrown by 'matplotlib.pyplot.show()' function to prevent system-level details from being exposed. The error messages should be logged securely and a generic error message should be shown to the user.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Cryptography (CWE-327)
Issue: The np.angle() function is used on potentially sensitive data without any form of encryption or secure handling. This could potentially lead to exposure of sensitive data.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted before it is processed. Python provides several libraries for secure data handling and encryption, such as the 'cryptography' library.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Correct FilterType Processing
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_filtertype_processing
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the FilterType object processes the input correctly, producing an expected set of outputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a FilterType object with known parameters and a set of inputs.
  Act: Invoke the show_phase_response function with the created FilterType object and a specified sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the outputs produced by the FilterType object match the expected outputs.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the FilterType object is processing inputs correctly, which is a crucial part of the function's operation.

Scenario 2: Correct Frequency Range
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_frequency_range
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly sets the frequency range on the plot.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a FilterType object and a set of inputs.
  Act: Invoke the show_phase_response function with the created FilterType object and a specified sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the x-axis of the plot spans from 24 to the Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate).
Validation:
  This test is important because the frequency range of the plot is a key aspect of the function's operation, and it must be set correctly for the plot to be meaningful.

Scenario 3: Correct Phase Shift Range
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_phase_shift_range
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly sets the phase shift range on the plot.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a FilterType object and a set of inputs.
  Act: Invoke the show_phase_response function with the created FilterType object and a specified sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the y-axis of the plot spans from -2*pi to 2*pi.
Validation:
  This test is important because the phase shift range of the plot is a key aspect of the function's operation, and it must be set correctly for the plot to be meaningful.

Scenario 4: Correct Zero-Padding
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_zero_padding
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly applies zero-padding to the outputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a FilterType object and a set of inputs.
  Act: Invoke the show_phase_response function with the created FilterType object and a specified sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the length of the outputs array, after zero-padding, matches the sample rate.
Validation:
  This test is important because zero-padding is a crucial part of the function's operation, ensuring that the FFT operates correctly. 

Scenario 5: Correct FFT Operation
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_fft_operation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly applies the FFT to the outputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a FilterType object and a set of inputs.
  Act: Invoke the show_phase_response function with the created FilterType object and a specified sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the FFT of the outputs matches the expected FFT results.
Validation:
  This test is important because the FFT is a crucial part of the function's operation, transforming the time-domain outputs into the frequency domain.
