================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Third-party library vulnerabilities
Issue: The code uses third-party libraries (`matplotlib` and `numpy`). If these libraries have any vulnerabilities, then your code is also vulnerable.
Solution: Always use the latest, patched versions of all libraries. Regularly check for updates and apply them.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Correct Phase Response
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_phase_response
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly computes the phase response of the filter and plots it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter of type FilterType and a samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized filter and samplerate.
  Assert: The function should compute the phase response correctly and display a plot. Check if the plot is correctly displayed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly applies the Fourier transform to compute the phase response and properly plots it.

Scenario 2: Test for Correct Frequency Range
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_frequency_range
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly plots the frequency range from 24 to the Nyquist frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter of type FilterType and a samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized filter and samplerate.
  Assert: The function should plot the frequency range correctly. Check if the x-axis of the plot ranges from 24 to the Nyquist frequency.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly plots the frequency range as per the requirement.

Scenario 3: Test for Correct Phase Shift Range
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_phase_shift_range
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly plots the phase shift range from -2*pi to 2*pi.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter of type FilterType and a samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized filter and samplerate.
  Assert: The function should plot the phase shift range correctly. Check if the y-axis of the plot ranges from -2*pi to 2*pi.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly plots the phase shift range as per the requirement.

Scenario 4: Test for Zero-Padding
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_padding
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly applies zero-padding to the outputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter of type FilterType and a samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized filter and samplerate.
  Assert: The function should apply zero-padding correctly. Check if the length of the outputs after zero-padding equals the samplerate.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly applies zero-padding to the outputs as per the requirement.

Scenario 5: Test for Correct Inputs Processing
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_inputs_processing
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly processes the inputs through the filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter of type FilterType and a samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function show_phase_response with the initialized filter and samplerate.
  Assert: The function should process the inputs correctly. Check if the outputs are the result of processing the inputs through the filter.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly processes the inputs through the filter as per the requirement.
