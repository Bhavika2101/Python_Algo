================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Third-Party Dependencies
Issue: The code depends on a third-party package, 'audio_filters'. If this package has any security vulnerabilities, they would indirectly affect this code as well.
Solution: Ensure that the 'audio_filters' package is up-to-date and doesn't have any known security vulnerabilities. Regularly review the package's updates and changelogs for any security fixes. Consider using a tool like PyUp Safety to automatically check your dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the make_lowshelf for valid inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_valid_inputs
  Description: This test will validate the make_lowshelf function's ability to create a low-shelf filter when provided with valid inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, gain_db and q_factor with appropriate values.
  Act: Invoke the make_lowshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: The output of the function should match the expected output.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This scenario is important to validate that the make_lowshelf function works as expected when provided with valid inputs. The result should align with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Testing the make_lowshelf function for filter coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_filter_coefficients
  Description: This test will validate the make_lowshelf function's ability to correctly compute the filter coefficients.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, gain_db and q_factor with appropriate values.
  Act: Invoke the make_lowshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: The filter coefficients (a_coeffs and b_coeffs) should match the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This scenario is important to validate that the make_lowshelf function correctly computes the filter coefficients. The result should align with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Testing the make_lowshelf function for zero gain_db
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_zero_gain
  Description: This test will validate the make_lowshelf function's ability to handle zero gain_db.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, gain_db (as 0) and q_factor with appropriate values.
  Act: Invoke the make_lowshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: The output of the function should match the expected output.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This scenario is important to validate that the make_lowshelf function can handle zero gain_db. The result should align with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 4: Testing the make_lowshelf function for negative gain_db
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_negative_gain
  Description: This test will validate the make_lowshelf function's ability to handle negative gain_db.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, gain_db (as a negative number) and q_factor with appropriate values.
  Act: Invoke the make_lowshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: The output of the function should match the expected output.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This scenario is important to validate that the make_lowshelf function can handle negative gain_db. The result should align with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 5: Testing the make_lowshelf function for zero frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_zero_frequency
  Description: This test will validate the make_lowshelf function's ability to handle zero frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency (as 0), samplerate, gain_db and q_factor with appropriate values.
  Act: Invoke the make_lowshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: The output of the function should match the expected output.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This scenario is important to validate that the make_lowshelf function can handle zero frequency. The result should align with the function's specifications and business requirements.
