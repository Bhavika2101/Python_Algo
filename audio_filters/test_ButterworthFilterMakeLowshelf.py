================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Invalid input parameters
Issue: The function make_lowshelf does not perform any check on the validity of the inputs. This may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the inputs are not valid.
Solution: Add checks to verify that frequency, samplerate, gain_db, and q_factor are numbers of the correct sign and magnitude. For example, make sure that frequency and samplerate are positive integers, gain_db is a finite floating point number, and q_factor is a positive floating point number.

Vulnerability: Usage of third-party package
Issue: This code imports the IIRFilter class from the audio_filters.iir_filter package. If this package has any vulnerabilities, they could potentially be exploited.
Solution: Ensure the third-party package is up-to-date and has been reviewed for potential vulnerabilities. Also, only necessary components of the package should be imported to limit exposure to potential risks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test make_lowshelf function with normal input values
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_with_normal_values
  Description: This test verifies the make_lowshelf function when the frequency, sample rate, gain_db, and q_factor are given as standard input without any extreme values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the input values will be provided directly to the function.
  Act: Invoke make_lowshelf function with frequency = 1000, sample rate = 48000, gain_db = 6 and q_factor = 1 / sqrt(2)
  Assert: The returned filter has correct coefficients
Validation:
  This tests the function in a normal operational situation, ensuring that it properly computes the filter's coefficients with provided parameters.

Scenario 2: Higher frequency edge case
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_with_higher_frequency
  Description: This test aims to validate the make_lowshelf function with very high frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the input values will be provided directly to the function.
  Act: Invoke make_lowshelf function with a frequency significantly higher than the sample rate, and standard values for other parameters.
  Assert: The coefficients of the filter might produce unexpected results due to the frequency/sample rate ratio being greater than or equal to 1. 
Validation: 
  This test simulates an edge case where the frequency is larger than the sample rate. This would help understand the function's behavior with such high frequencies that might be produced due to erroneous input.

Scenario 3: Lower frequency edge case
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_with_lower_frequency
  Description: This test aims to validate make_lowshelf function with a very low frequency compared to the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the input values will be provided directly to the function.
  Act: Invoke the function with frequency significantly less than the sample rate and standard values for the other parameters.
  Assert: The coefficients of the filter would be valid given that the function handles a frequency/sample rate ratio as close to 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle the edge case where the frequency is much less than the sample rate, which might be produced due to some fault in the system or erroneous input.

Scenario 4: Zero gain_db case
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_with_zero_gain_db
  Description: This test aims to verify the behavior of the make_lowshelf function when gain_db = 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the input values will be provided directly to the function.
  Act: Invoke the function with gain_db = 0 and standard values for the other parameters.
  Assert: The coefficients of the returned filter should reflect the "pass-through" nature of a filter with a gain of 0 dB.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case with zero gain_db, mimicking the behavior of a "pass-through" state.

Scenario 5: Negative gain_db case
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_with_negative_gain_db
  Description: This test aims to validate the behavior of the make_lowshelf function when gain_db is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the input values will be provided directly to the function.
  Act: Invoke the function with a negative gain_db and standard values for the other parameters.
  Assert: The coefficients of the returned filter should reflect this "attenuated" state.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case of a negative gain_db, mimicking the behavior of an "attenuated" state of the filter.
