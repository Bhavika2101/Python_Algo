================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The function 'make_bandpass' does not validate its inputs. Consequently, unexpected or malicious input could lead to erroneous computation or potentially harmful behaviour.
Solution: Add checks at the beginning of the function to ensure 'frequency', 'samplerate', and 'q_factor' are within expected ranges and of correct types.

Vulnerability: Dependency Security
Issue: The 'audio_filters.iir_filter' package is used without specifying a version. This could potentially allow usage of a version that contains known vulnerabilities.
Solution: Always specify a version when importing third-party packages. If the package 'audio_filters.iir_filter' uses semantic versioning, use compatible release syntax to ensure non-breaking updates are allowed. For example: audio_filters==1.0.1

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate Positive Frequency, Positive Sample Rate, Default Q-Factor
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_frequency_positive_samplerate_default_qfactor
  Description: This test verifies if `make_bandpass` function is able to create a filter with positive frequency, positive sample rate and default q-factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency as 1000 and sample rate as 48000.
  Act: Invoke `make_bandpass` function with the parameters frequency and sample rate.
  Assert: Validate if the function returns an IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies if `make_bandpass` function is capable of creating a filter with a positive frequency, positive sample rate and a default q-factor. This is essential since these are usual input parameters.

Scenario 2: Validate Non-Default, Positive Q-Factor
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_qfactor
  Description: This test verifies if the `make_bandpass` function can create a filter with a non-default, positive q-factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency as 1000, sample rate as 48000 and q_factor as 2.
  Act: Invoke `make_bandpass` function with the parameters frequency, sample rate, and q_factor.
  Assert: Validate if the function returns an IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  Through this scenario, we test if the `make_bandpass` function can handle non-default, positive q-factors, which is important for varying the filter's bandwidth. 

Scenario 3: Validate Zero Frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_frequency
  Description: This test verifies whether `make_bandpass` function can handle a frequency of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency as 0 and sample rate as 48000. 
  Act: Invoke `make_bandpass` function with the parameters frequency and sample rate. 
  Assert: Validate if the function returns an IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  This scenario checks whether the `make_bandpass` function can handle limits, such as a zero frequency. Though such filters are impractical, they might be useful for certain edge cases in software testing.

Scenario 4: Validate Zero SampleRate
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_samplerate
  Description: This test verifies how the `make_bandpass` function performs with a samplerate of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency as 1000 and samplerate as 0.
  Act: Invoke `make_bandpass` function with the parameters frequency and samplerate.
  Assert: The program should throw a division by zero exception.
Validation:
  This scenario tests if the `make_bandpass` function can correctly handle edge cases like a zero sample rate and is capable of throwing the appropriate exceptions.

Scenario 5: Validate Negative Q Factor
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of `make_bandpass` function with a negative q-factor. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency as 1000, samplerate as 48000, and q_factor as -1.
  Act: Invoke `make_bandpass` function with the parameters frequency, samplerate, and q_factor.
  Assert: The function should throw error indicating that q_factor must be greater than zero.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the ability of `make_bandpass` function to correctly handle input errors and throw appropriate exceptions.
