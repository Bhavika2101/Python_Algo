================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The function make_bandpass accepts inputs but does not validate them. If invalid data is supplied (negative, non-integers, etc.), it could lead to unexpected behavior or breaks
Solution: Add input validation checks to the function to make sure that they are within the expected range and type. This significantly reduces the probability of unhandled exceptions that might crash your program

Vulnerability: Error handling (CWE-703)
Issue: The function assumes successful execution of every operation and does not feature any error handling or exception management. This can lead to crashes or unknown states in case of exceptions
Solution: Implement good error handling mechanisms. Use 'try/except' blocks to capture and handle exceptions properly to prevent program crashes

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid band-pass filter creation with default q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_default_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies the creation of a band-pass filter with correct coefficients when the q_factor is not provided and defaults to 1 / sqrt(2).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special preparation of the environment needs to be made.
  Act: Call make_bandpass function with frequency and samplerate as parameters. 
  Assert: Verify the a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the filter match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test validates that the default argument for q_factor is correctly applied in the filter calculation formula.

Scenario 2: Valid band-pass filter creation with custom q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_custom_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies the creation of a band-pass filter with correct coefficients when the q_factor argument is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special preparation of the environment needs to be made.
  Act: Call make_bandpass function with frequency, samplerate and a custom q_factor as parameters.
  Assert: Verify the a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the filter match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test validates that the provided q_factor argument is correctly applied in the filter calculation formula.

Scenario 3: Zero Frequency parameter
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_zero_frequency
  Description: The test verifies that the function works correctly when provided zero as the frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special preparation of the environment needs to be made.
  Act: Call make_bandpass function with zero frequency and valid samplerate.
  Assert: Verify the a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the filter match the expected values. 
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function can handle edge case of a zero frequency, which is useful for creating a 'stop-all' filter.

Scenario 4: Frequency equals samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_frequency_equals_samplerate
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when the frequency equals samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special preparation of the environment needs to be made.
  Act: Call make_bandpass function with frequency equal to the samplerate.
  Assert: Verify the a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the filter match the expected values. 
Validation:
  This scenario tests one edge case for the function. The relevance is that this situation could cause NaN or Infinity results if not handled properly in the function's implementation.

Scenario 5: High Q-factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_high_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when a high q_factor value is supplied.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special preparation of the environment needs to be made.
  Act: Call make_bandpass function with valid frequency, samplerate, and a high q_factor.
  Assert: Verify the a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the filter match the expected values. 
Validation:
  This scenario tests the edge case for high q_factor values, which can cause problems if not handled correctly in the function.
