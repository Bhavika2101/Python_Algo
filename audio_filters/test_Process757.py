================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The code does not seem to restrict or check the type of 'sample' parameter in the 'process' function. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if a non-float value is passed.
Solution: Ensure that the 'sample' parameter is of the correct type (float) before performing operations on it. This can be done using Python's isinstance function.

Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: The code imports and potentially uses the 'matplotlib.pyplot' and 'numpy' libraries without sanitizing or validating the data that might be plotted or processed. This could potentially lead to exposure of sensitive information in logs.
Solution: Ensure that any data plotted or processed with 'matplotlib.pyplot' and 'numpy' is properly sanitized and validated to prevent exposure of sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The code imports the entire 'math' library, which includes some functions that can be potentially dangerous if used improperly, such as 'pow', 'sqrt', etc.
Solution: Instead of importing the entire 'math' library, import only the necessary functions. This can help reduce the risk of using potentially dangerous functions inadvertently.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validating calculation with positive sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_sample
  Description: This test verifies that the process function correctly calculates y[n] when given a positive float sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no objects are being initialized.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a positive float sample.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function is able to handle positive float inputs and return the correct calculations.

Scenario 2: Validating calculation with negative sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_sample
  Description: This test verifies that the process function correctly calculates y[n] when given a negative float sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no objects are being initialized.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a negative float sample.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function is able to handle negative float inputs and return the correct calculations.

Scenario 3: Validating calculation with zero sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_sample
  Description: This test verifies that the process function correctly calculates y[n] when given a zero float sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no objects are being initialized.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a zero float sample.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function is able to handle zero float inputs and return the correct calculations.

Scenario 4: Validating calculation with maximum float sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_max_float_sample
  Description: This test verifies that the process function correctly calculates y[n] when given a maximum float sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no objects are being initialized.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a maximum float sample.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function is able to handle the maximum float inputs and return the correct calculations.

Scenario 5: Validating calculation with minimum float sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_min_float_sample
  Description: This test verifies that the process function correctly calculates y[n] when given a minimum float sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no objects are being initialized.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a minimum float sample.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function is able to handle the minimum float inputs and return the correct calculations.
