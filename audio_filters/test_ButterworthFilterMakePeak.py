================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure dependencies
Issue: The code imports the 'audio_filters.iir_filter' package. If the package isn't well-maintained, it might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Moreover, it can break the application if the package or its dependencies are deprecated.
Solution: Ensure that the 'audio_filters.iir_filter' package is from a trusted source and is being actively maintained. Regularly update the package to get security updates. Consider the use of tools like 'piprot', 'safety' or 'pyup' that would help to keep third party packages up-to-date and alert if they have known vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
```python
Scenario 1: Test for correct peak filter coefficients.
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_peak_filter_coefficients
  Description: Test is intended to verify that the make_peak function correctly calculates and assigns the IIRFilter coefficients when given valid input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: None. There is no required setup for this test.
  Act: Call the make_peak function with valid frequency, sample rate, gain_db, and q_factor parameters.
  Assert: Check that the total of a_coeffs and b_coeffs in the resulting IIRFilter matches the expected output as per provided in the example.
Validation:
  This test verifies the correctness of the core business logic encapsulated in the make_peak function. As such it is vital to the function's overall correctness that the coefficients are properly calculated and assigned.

Scenario 2: Test for proper handling of a zero q_factor.
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_q_factor_handling
  Description: Test is intended to verify that the make_peak function correctly handles a zero q_factor input.
Execution:
  Arrange: None. There is no required setup for this test.
  Act: Call the make_peak function with valid frequency, sample rate, gain_db parameters and a q_factor of zero.
  Assert: Check for a ZeroDivisionError being thrown.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function makes the necessary exception handling for division by zero conditions in its calculations.

Scenario 3: Test for proper handling of a negative gain_db.
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_gain_db_handling
  Description: Test is intended to verify that the make_peak function correctly handles a negative gain_db input as audio gain is commonly represented in negative dB values.
Execution:
  Arrange: None. There is no required setup for this test.
  Act: Call the make_peak function with valid frequency, sample rate, q_factor parameters, and a negative gain_db.
  Assert: Check that the total of a_coeffs and b_coeffs in the resulting IIRFilter matches the expected output when gain_db is negative.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function is performing correctly with negative gain values, which are typical in audio signal processing.

Scenario 4: Test for proper handling of a zero frequency.
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_frequency_handling
  Description: Test is intended to verify that the make_peak function correctly handles a zero frequency input.
Execution:
  Arrange: None. There is no required setup for this test.
  Act: Call the make_peak function with a frequency of zero along with valid sample rate, gain_db, q_factor parameters.
  Assert: Check for an error being thrown or the output coefficients being NaN (Not a Number), as the frequency cannot be zero in the context of a peak filter.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles edge case inputs that are technically valid but not meaningful in the context of the business logic.
