================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The function make_peak does not perform any validation on its inputs. If invalid values are passed (e.g., zero or negative values), it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Add checks at the beginning of the function to validate the inputs. If an invalid value is detected, the function should raise a ValueError with a descriptive error message.

Vulnerability: Error Handling
Issue: The function make_peak does not handle potential runtime errors, such as division by zero.
Solution: Include a try-except block in the function to catch and handle potential errors in a controlled manner.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test that the function correctly creates an IIRFilter object with the correct coefficients for a given set of parameters.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_peak_correct_coefficients
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates and sets the coefficients of the IIRFilter object it creates based on the input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a set of input parameters (frequency, samplerate, gain_db, q_factor).
  Act: Call the make_peak function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check that the IIRFilter object returned has the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important because the coefficients of the IIRFilter object determine its behavior, so it's critical that they are calculated and set correctly.

Scenario 2: Test that the function correctly handles a gain_db of zero.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_peak_zero_gain
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a gain_db of zero, which should result in an IIRFilter object with no gain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a set of input parameters with gain_db set to zero.
  Act: Call the make_peak function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check that the IIRFilter object returned has the expected coefficients, indicating no gain.
Validation:
  This test is important because a gain_db of zero is a special case that may not be handled correctly by all implementations.

Scenario 3: Test that the function correctly handles a negative gain_db.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_peak_negative_gain
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a negative gain_db, which should result in an IIRFilter object with a gain less than one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a set of input parameters with gain_db set to a negative value.
  Act: Call the make_peak function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check that the IIRFilter object returned has the expected coefficients, indicating a gain less than one.
Validation:
  This test is important because a negative gain_db is a valid input that should result in a specific behavior.

Scenario 4: Test that the function correctly handles a frequency that is higher than the samplerate.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_peak_high_frequency
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a frequency that is higher than the samplerate, which should result in an IIRFilter object with coefficients indicating a high-pass filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a set of input parameters with frequency set to a value higher than the samplerate.
  Act: Call the make_peak function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check that the IIRFilter object returned has the expected coefficients, indicating a high-pass filter.
Validation:
  This test is important because a frequency higher than the samplerate is a valid input that should result in a specific behavior.
