================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The function `show_frequency_response` directly uses the `filter_type` object passed to it, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the response.
Solution: Implement proper access controls and input validation. Ensure that the `filter_type` object is of the expected type and has the necessary properties before using it.

Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption or CWE-400
Issue: The `show_frequency_response` function creates a list of zeros with length `samplerate - size`. If `samplerate` is a large number, it could consume a lot of memory and potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).
Solution: Apply limits to the size of `samplerate`. Implement checks to ensure `samplerate` does not exceed a certain value.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') or CWE-79
Issue: The `show_frequency_response` function uses `plt.plot`, which can potentially execute malicious JavaScript code if it is embedded in the `fft_db` data.
Solution: Sanitize the `fft_db` data to ensure it does not contain any executable code. Use a library or function that automatically performs this sanitization.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the frequency response for a given filter type and sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_valid_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can correctly display the frequency response for a given filter type and sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter type and a sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the function `show_frequency_response` with the initialized filter type and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function does not throw any exceptions and the graph is displayed correctly.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Validate the frequency response for a minimum sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_min_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can correctly handle the minimum possible sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter type and a sample rate of 1.
  Act: Invoke the function `show_frequency_response` with the initialized filter type and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function does not throw any exceptions and the graph is displayed correctly.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Validate the frequency response when the filter type is None
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_none_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles a None filter type correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter type as None and a valid sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the function `show_frequency_response` with the initialized filter type and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function throws an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 4: Validate the frequency response for a negative sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_negative_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles a negative sample rate correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter type and a sample rate of -1.
  Act: Invoke the function `show_frequency_response` with the initialized filter type and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function throws an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 5: Validate the frequency response when the filter type and sample rate are None
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_none_filter_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles a None filter type and sample rate correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter type and a sample rate as None.
  Act: Invoke the function `show_frequency_response` with the initialized filter type and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function throws an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements.
