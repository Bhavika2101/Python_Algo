================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The submitted code does not perform any input validation checks on the `filter_type` and `samplerate` arguments passed to the `show_frequency_response` function. If an attacker can control those arguments, they could potentially exploit this to pass malicious inputs and perform a variety of nasty activities.
Solution: Perform proper input validation checks. Ensure the `filter_type` argument is an instance of the expected class and that `samplerate` is an integer within an acceptable range.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The code submits data directly to matplotlib for plotting. If the data were sensitive - such as proprietary algorithms represented as filters - this might represent an information leakage vulnerability.
Solution: Ensure that the data being plotted by matplotlib does not contain confidential or sensitive information. If necessary, apply anonymization techniques to the data before plotting.

Vulnerability: Insecure Third-Party Libraries (CWE-1173)
Issue: The code to be analyzed utilizes external libraries (matplotlib and numpy). Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries can lead to serious threats and attacks if not updated regularly.
Solution: Ensure the libraries and modules being imported in the code are up to date. Keep track of vulnerabilities and security updates in those third-party libraries.

Scenario 1: Test frequency response of a high-order filter
Details:
  TestName: test_high_order_filter_frequency_response
  Description: This test verifies that the function can calculate and display the frequency response of a high-order filter. A high-order filter provides a steeper roll-off than a lower-order filter for equivalent designs.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of a high-order digital filter is created with an order of 6 or above.
  Act: The function is invoked with the high-order filter and a commonly used samplerate such as 44100 as parameters.
  Assert: The test verifies that the function effectively calculates the frequency response and displays the filtered signal where higher frequencies are noticeably attenuated.
Validation: 
  It's essential to validate that high-order filters are processed correctly because they have complex frequency responses that must be accurately depicted for effective sound filtering.

Scenario 2: Test frequency response display within reasonable bounds
Details:
  TestName: test_display_bounds
  Description: This test verifies that the frequency response of a filter is correctly displayed within reasonable gain bounds of -80 to 80 dB.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of a digital filter is created.
  Act: The function is invoked with the filter and a samplerate as parameters.
  Assert: The test verifies that the `plt.ylim` function is configured correctly to limit the spectral graph's gain range to -80 to 80 dB.
Validation: 
  The perceived loudness of the frequency response (expressed in dB) can vary over a large range. Limiting the graph to a reasonable range of -80 to 80 dB makes it easier to inspect and interpret.

Scenario 3: Test frequency response of a filter with varying sample rates
Details:
  TestName: test_frequency_response_varying_sample_rates
  Description: This test aims to verify that the function accurately calculates and displays the frequency response for a filter with varying sample rates.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of a digital filter is created.
  Act: The function is invoked repeatedly with the filter and varying sample rates: 22050 Hz, 44100 Hz, and 96000 Hz.
  Assert: The test verifies that the frequency response accurately represents the filter's output when applied to these sample rates.
Validation: 
  Validating the frequency response with different sample rates is important because they can significantly affect the quality of the resulting digital sound reproduction.

Scenario 4: Test display of frequency response in logarithmic scale
Details:
  TestName: test_log_scale_display
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly displays the frequency response in a logarithmic scale.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of a digital filter is created.
  Act: The function is invoked with the filter and a samplerate as parameters.
  Assert: The test verifies that the `plt.xscale` function is called with the parameter "log", indicating a logarithmic scale for frequency axis.
Validation: 
  Operators often prefer to see the frequency range on a logarithmic scale, which accommodates the human perception of pitch and the representation of audio signals.
