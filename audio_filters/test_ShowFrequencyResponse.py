================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The function `show_frequency_response` directly uses the `filter_type` object passed to it, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the response.
Solution: Implement input validation or sanitization for the `filter_type` object before using it. Use a whitelist of allowed input types.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: The function `show_frequency_response` does not limit the size of the input `samplerate`, which can lead to high memory usage if a large value is provided.
Solution: Implement a limit for the `samplerate` input to prevent excessive memory usage.

Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: The function `show_frequency_response` does not sanitize or escape the input `samplerate` before using it in a logging statement, potentially leading to log injection attacks.
Solution: Sanitize or escape the `samplerate` input before using it in a logging statement.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The function `show_frequency_response` does not validate the `filter_type` input, potentially allowing an attacker to access or modify files in unauthorized directories.
Solution: Implement input validation for the `filter_type` input, and ensure it does not contain path traversal sequences.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The function `show_frequency_response` does not handle exceptions, potentially exposing sensitive information in error messages.
Solution: Implement exception handling in the `show_frequency_response` function to prevent exposure of sensitive information in error messages.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify Filter Processing
Details:
  TestName: test_filter_processing
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the filter_type.process function correctly processes the input array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the filter_type object with appropriate parameters and an input array of size 512 with the first element as 1 and the rest as 0.
  Act: Invoke the show_frequency_response function with the filter_type object and a sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the output array has the correct size and values based on the filter_type.process function.
Validation:
  This test is important because it ensures that the filter_type.process function is correctly implemented and that it correctly processes the input array.

Scenario 2: Verify Frequency Response Plotting
Details:
  TestName: test_frequency_response_plotting
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the frequency response of the filter is correctly plotted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the filter_type object with appropriate parameters and invoke the show_frequency_response function with the filter_type object and a sample rate.
  Act: Capture the output plot.
  Assert: Check that the plot has the correct x and y axes labels, x and y limits, and that the plot displays the correct frequency response based on the filter_type and sample rate.
Validation:
  This test is important because it ensures that the frequency response of the filter is correctly plotted, which is crucial for visualizing the performance of the filter.

Scenario 3: Verify Zero-Padding
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_padding
  Description: This test is intended to verify that zero-padding is correctly applied to the output array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the filter_type object with appropriate parameters and an input array of size 512 with the first element as 1 and the rest as 0.
  Act: Invoke the show_frequency_response function with the filter_type object and a sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the output array has the correct size based on the sample rate and that the elements beyond the size of the input array are all zero.
Validation:
  This test is important because it ensures that zero-padding is correctly applied to the output array, which is crucial for the frequency response calculation.

Scenario 4: Verify Gain Bounds
Details:
  TestName: test_gain_bounds
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the gain bounds are correctly applied to the plot.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the filter_type object with appropriate parameters and invoke the show_frequency_response function with the filter_type object and a sample rate.
  Act: Capture the output plot.
  Assert: Check that the y limits of the plot are within the range of -80 to 80 dB.
Validation:
  This test is important because it ensures that the gain bounds are correctly applied to the plot, which is crucial for visualizing the gain of the filter.
