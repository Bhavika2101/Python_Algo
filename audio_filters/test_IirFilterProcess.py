================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Input Data (CWE-20)
Issue: Python code can be vulnerable to injection attacks if it uses input data in a security-sensitive context without validating or sanitizing it.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize input data before using it in a security-sensitive context. Use parameterized queries for database access.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependencies (CWE-937)
Issue: Python code can be vulnerable to various security issues if it uses third-party packages that have not been properly vetified or are outdated.
Solution: Always use the latest version of third-party packages, and verify their security before use. Consider using a tool like PyUp Safety to check for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Cryptography (CWE-327)
Issue: Python code can be vulnerable to attacks if it uses insecure or outdated cryptographic algorithms for sensitive operations like encryption, hashing, or digital signatures.
Solution: Always use secure and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms provided by a reputable cryptographic library like PyCryptodome.

Vulnerability: Insecure Configuration (CWE-16)
Issue: Python code can be vulnerable to attacks if it is run with an insecure configuration, such as running with excessive privileges or insecure default settings.
Solution: Always run Python code with the least privileges necessary, and review your configuration settings to ensure they are secure.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the process function with a zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function returns 0.0 when the input sample is 0.0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with the order 2.
  Act: Invoke the process function with the parameter 0.0.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is 0.0.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the process function with zero input. The expected result is based on the function's documentation, which states that it should return 0.0 when the input sample is 0.0.

Scenario 2: Testing the process function with a non-zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_non_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function calculates the correct result when the input sample is non-zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with the order 2 and set the coefficients and history values.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a non-zero parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is the expected calculated value.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's ability to process non-zero inputs correctly. The expected result is calculated based on the function's algorithm.

Scenario 3: Testing the process function's effect on input_history
Details:
  TestName: test_process_effect_on_input_history
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly updates the input_history after processing a sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with the order 2 and set the initial input_history.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a non-zero parameter.
  Assert: Check that the input_history is updated correctly.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies that the function correctly maintains the input history, which is a crucial part of its algorithm.

Scenario 4: Testing the process function's effect on output_history
Details:
  TestName: test_process_effect_on_output_history
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly updates the output_history after processing a sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with the order 2 and set the initial output_history.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a non-zero parameter.
  Assert: Check that the output_history is updated correctly.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies that the function correctly maintains the output history, which is a crucial part of its algorithm.

Scenario 5: Testing the process function with a negative input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function handles negative input samples correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with the order 2 and set the coefficients and history values.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a negative parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is the expected calculated value.
Validation:
  This test is important as it ensures that the function can handle negative input values, which is a valid scenario in its usage. The expected result is calculated based on the function's algorithm.
