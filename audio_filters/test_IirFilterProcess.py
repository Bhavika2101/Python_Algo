================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function 'process' doesn't perform any type of input validation. This can lead to unintended behaviours, crashes, or worse, code execution if an attacker provides malicious inputs. Especially with 'sample' argument
Solution: Ensure all inputs are validated before usage. Use Python's built-in types, or checks to make sure that incoming data is the expected type, length, format, and range. For 'sample' argument, confirm it's a float.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: There is no check to determine whether 'self.b_coeffs', 'self.a_coeffs', 'self.input_history' or 'self.output_history' are None before they are used. This can cause a NoneType error if any of them is None.
Solution: Before usage, check to ensure that 'self.b_coeffs', 'self.a_coeffs', 'self.input_history', and 'self.output_history' are not None. Terminating if they are, or providing meaningful defaults.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Correct computation of the processing function
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_computation
  Description: Verifies if the processing function properly computes the result using input sample, b_coeffs, a_coeffs, input_history, output_history, and order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object with set b_coeff, a_coeff, input_history, output_history, and order.
  Act: Invoke the process function using a known sample number.
  Assert: Verify that the outcome is correct and matches the expected result.
Validation:
  Demonstrates the basic functionality of the provided processing function and its ability to correctly evaluate the result.

Scenario 2: Handling of zero coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_coefficients
  Description: Verifies if the function can handle scenarios where all coefficients are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object with b_coeff, a_coeff, input_history, output_history all set to zero and with an order of 2.
  Act: Execute the processing function with the zero coefficient context.
  Assert: Examine whether the function return value is zero.
Validation:
  Confirm the function's ability to appropriately manage situations where all coefficients have zero values - an essential use case that may occur during calculation.

Scenario 3: Addressing negative coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_coefficients
  Description: Tests whether the function can work properly with negative coefficients.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a filter object with negative b_coeff, a_coeff, input_history, output_history, and an order of 2.
  Act: Run the processing function with negative coefficients.
  Assert: Compare the results with expected values computed outside the function, given the same inputs.
Validation:
  Ensures that the method can accurately compute results even with negative coefficients, which is part of its required general functionality.

Scenario 4: Proper update of take history after process
Details:
  TestName: test_updated_history
  Description: Verifies if the function properly updates the input_history and output_history after each operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object with known b_coeff, a_coeff, input_history, output_history, and order.
  Act: Execute the processing function and then retrieve the updated input_history and output_history.
  Assert: Confirm if the histories have been updated correctly after the process operation.
Validation:
  Guarantees that the function updates the input and output histories accurately which is critical for subsequent operations in temporal signal processing.

Scenario 5: Correct behavior with high order numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_high_order_numbers
  Description: Verifies the correct functioning of the method with high order numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the filter object with a high order number, and establish b_coeff, a_coeff, input_history, output_history.
  Act: Invoke the process function.
  Assert: Compare the returned result with the expected outcome.
Validation:
  Demonstrates the scalability of the function and confirms functionality even for high order numbers. 

Scenario 6: Confirming division by zero handling
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero_handling
  Description: Verifies how the system handles situations where division by zero might occur.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a_coeff[0] to zero while initializing the filter object.
  Act: Invoke the process function.
  Assert: Check if the system handles this scenario through error handling or other means and does not crash.
Validation:
  Tests the system's robustness in edge cases or potentially problematic situations and validates that these scenarios are handled without system crashes.
