================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The function process accepts a sample argument but does not validate it. This may lead to unexpected errors or results if wrong type or value of data is passed to the function.
Solution: Use Python's type hinting feature to give hints about the input type. Also you can add checks to validate that the input falls within expected range/values. For example, if expecting a float, verify that sample is truly a float.

Vulnerability: Unsafe use of Self
Issue: The function process uses self referencing several times. If the class containing this function is not correctly controlling its state or if the state is unexpectedly modified at runtime, it may lead to errors or unexpected results.
Solution: Ensure that the state of the class is being controlled effectively and is not being modified unexpectedly at runtime. Use getters and setters or property decorators to control access to class attributes.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Processing with zero coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_coeffs
  Description: This test verifies the base case scenario in which the coefficients 'b_coeffs' and 'a_coeffs' of the IIRFilter are all zeros.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of IIRFilter is created with all zero coefficients, and a sample input is prepared.
  Act: The process function is invoked with the sample input.
  Assert: The result must be 0 as all coefficients are 0.
Validation:
  This checks the fundamental case where any multiplying factors (i.e., the b and a coefficients) are zero, thus ensuring the function handles it correctly.

Scenario 2: Validation of IIR filter's output history management
Details:
  TestName: test_output_history_management
  Description: The test validates that the IIR filter's output history is accurately updated after each invocation of 'process'.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of IIRFilter is created, and a sample input is prepared.
  Act: The process function is invoked with the sample input and the output is monitored.
  Assert: Asserting the output history array, ensuring the output of 'process' is at index 0 and other indices are updated appropriately.
Validation:
  Ensuring correct maintenance of output history after each process invocation is crucial to the correct operation of an IIR Filter.

Scenario 3: Exception due to division by zero
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_division_exception
  Description: This test identifies a scenario where the process function attempts to divide by zero, which should raise a ZeroDivisionError.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of IIRFilter is created with zero as the first coefficient in 'a_coeffs'.
  Act: The 'process' function is invoked with a sample input.
  Assert: Assert that a ZeroDivisionError is raised.
Validation:
  Validates that the function correctly identifies and raises an exception when a division by zero error happens due to 'a_coeffs[0]' being zero.

Scenario 4: Processing with positive coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_process_positive_coeffs
  Description: This test validates the process output when coefficients 'b_coeffs' and 'a_coeffs' of the IIRFilter are all positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of IIRFilter with positive coefficients is created, and a sample input is prepared.
  Act: The process function is invoked with the sample input.
  Assert: The result is checked against the mathematical computation.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function works accurately when all the coefficients are positive.

Scenario 5: Validation of IIR filter's input history management
Details:
  TestName: test_input_history_management
  Description: The test validates that the IIR filter's input history is accurately updated after each invocation of 'process'.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of IIRFilter is created, and a sample input is prepared.
  Act: The process function is invoked with the sample input and input history is monitored.
  Assert: Asserting the input history array, ensuring the input sample is at index 0 and other indices are updated appropriately.
Validation:
  Ensuring correct maintenance of input history after each process invocation is indispensable for the correct operation of an IIR Filter.
