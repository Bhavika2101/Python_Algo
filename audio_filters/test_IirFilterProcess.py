================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Input
Issue: If the input to the 'process' function is not controlled or sanitized, it could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Ensure that all inputs are validated and sanitized before they are processed. This can be achieved by adding checks before the 'process' function is called.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependencies
Issue: The code might be using insecure third-party packages or outdated versions of packages.
Solution: Regularly update all dependencies to their latest versions, and review them to ensure they do not have known security vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: Inadequate Error Handling
Issue: The 'process' function does not have any error handling mechanism. If it encounters an error during execution, it may crash or behave unpredictably.
Solution: Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms. This will help in identifying and troubleshooting issues in a timely manner.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the process function with a zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a zero input and returns the expected output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order.
  Act: Call the process function with 0 as the input.
  Assert: Check that the output is 0.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles a zero input, which is a common edge case in many applications.

Scenario 2: Testing the process function with a non-zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_non_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly calculates the result when given a non-zero input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order and a non-zero input.
  Act: Call the process function with the non-zero input.
  Assert: Check that the output is as expected based on the input and the coefficients of the filter.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly calculates the result based on the input and the coefficients of the filter.

Scenario 3: Testing the process function with negative input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a negative input and returns the expected output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order and a negative input.
  Act: Call the process function with the negative input.
  Assert: Check that the output is as expected based on the input and the coefficients of the filter.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles negative inputs, which can occur in many practical applications.

Scenario 4: Testing the process function with varying orders
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_varying_orders
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly calculates the result when the order of the filter varies.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with varying orders and a fixed input.
  Act: Call the process function with the fixed input.
  Assert: Check that the output is as expected based on the input and the coefficients of the filter.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly calculates the result when the order of the filter varies, which is a key aspect of the function's business logic.

Scenario 5: Testing the process function with maximum float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_max_float
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles the maximum float input without causing an overflow error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order and the maximum float input.
  Act: Call the process function with the maximum float input.
  Assert: Check that the output is as expected based on the input and the coefficients of the filter, and that no overflow error occurs.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function can handle maximum float inputs, which are a potential edge case in many applications.
