================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the type and value of 'sample', which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Add code to check the type and value of 'sample'. If it's not a float or outside the expected range, raise an appropriate exception.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code does not check if 'self.b_coeffs', 'self.a_coeffs', 'self.input_history', or 'self.output_history' are None before using them, which can lead to a TypeError if they are None.
Solution: Add code to check if these variables are None before using them. If any of them are None, raise an appropriate exception.

Vulnerability: CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
Issue: The code does not check if the index 'i' is within the bounds of the arrays 'self.b_coeffs', 'self.a_coeffs', 'self.input_history', or 'self.output_history'. This can lead to an IndexError.
Solution: Add code to check if 'i' is within the bounds of these arrays before using it as an index. If it's not, raise an appropriate exception.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the process function with a zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a zero input and returns a zero output as per the business logic encapsulated in the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the IIRFilter class and prepare the environment.
  Act: Invoke the process function with 0.0 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is 0.0.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the process function correctly handles zero input. The expected result is connected to the function's specifications which state that the output should be zero when the input is zero.

Scenario 2: Testing the process function with positive input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly processes a positive float input value and returns the expected output as per the business logic encapsulated in the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the IIRFilter class and prepare the environment.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a positive float as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is the expected float value.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the process function correctly handles positive float inputs. The expected result is connected to the function's specifications which state how the output should be calculated given a specific input.

Scenario 3: Testing the process function with negative input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly processes a negative float input value and returns the expected output as per the business logic encapsulated in the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the IIRFilter class and prepare the environment.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a negative float as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is the expected float value.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the process function correctly handles negative float inputs. The expected result is connected to the function's specifications which state how the output should be calculated given a specific input.

Scenario 4: Testing the process function with large float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly processes a large float input value and returns the expected output as per the business logic encapsulated in the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the IIRFilter class and prepare the environment.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a large float as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is the expected float value.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the process function can handle large float inputs. The expected result is connected to the function's specifications which state how the output should be calculated given a specific input.
