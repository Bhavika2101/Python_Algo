================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the type and value of 'sample', which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Add code to check the type and value of 'sample' before processing. If it is not a float or out of expected range, raise an exception or handle it appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code assumes that 'self.b_coeffs' and 'self.a_coeffs' are always non-null, which may not be the case.
Solution: Add null checks before accessing 'self.b_coeffs' and 'self.a_coeffs'. If they are null, raise an exception or handle it appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
Issue: The code does not check the size of 'self.input_history' and 'self.output_history' before copying values, which can lead to buffer overflow.
Solution: Add code to check the size of 'self.input_history' and 'self.output_history' before copying values. If they are not of the expected size, resize them or handle it appropriately.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the process function with a positive float number
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_float
  Description: This test is intended to verify the process function's ability to handle and process positive float numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a specific order and prepare a positive float number as input.
  Act: Invoke the process function with the positive float number.
  Assert: Check the returned result, it should be a float number.
Validation:
  This test is important because the process function should be capable of handling and processing positive float numbers correctly, which is a basic requirement of the function.

Scenario 2: Testing the process function with a negative float number
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_float
  Description: This test is intended to verify the process function's ability to handle and process negative float numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a specific order and prepare a negative float number as input.
  Act: Invoke the process function with the negative float number.
  Assert: Check the returned result, it should be a float number.
Validation:
  This test is important because the process function should be capable of handling and processing negative float numbers correctly, which is a standard requirement of the function.

Scenario 3: Testing the process function with zero
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify the process function's ability to handle and process zero correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a specific order and prepare zero as input.
  Act: Invoke the process function with zero.
  Assert: Check the returned result, it should be zero.
Validation:
  This test is important because the process function should be capable of handling and processing zero correctly, which is an edge case of the function.

Scenario 4: Testing the process function with very large float numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_float
  Description: This test is intended to verify the process function's ability to handle and process very large float numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a specific order and prepare a very large float number as input.
  Act: Invoke the process function with the large float number.
  Assert: Check the returned result, it should be a float number.
Validation:
  This test is important because the process function should be capable of handling and processing very large float numbers correctly, which is part of the function's robustness.

Scenario 5: Testing the process function with very small float numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_small_float
  Description: This test is intended to verify the process function's ability to handle and process very small float numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a specific order and prepare a very small float number as input.
  Act: Invoke the process function with the small float number.
  Assert: Check the returned result, it should be a float number.
Validation:
  This test is important because the process function should be capable of handling and processing very small float numbers correctly, which is part of the function's precision and accuracy.
