================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the type and value of 'sample', which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Add code to check the type and value of 'sample' before processing. If it is not a float or out of expected range, raise an exception or handle it appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The code does not check if the 'self.a_coeffs[0]' equals to zero before doing division, which can lead to a ZeroDivisionError.
Solution: Check if 'self.a_coeffs[0]' equals to zero before doing division. If it is zero, raise an exception or handle it appropriately.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing with zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a zero input value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in 0 as the input value.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles zero input, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Testing with positive input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a positive input value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a positive value as the input.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the expected result.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles positive input, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 3: Testing with negative input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a negative input value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a negative value as the input.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the expected result.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles negative input, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 4: Testing the function with large input values
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles large input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a large value as the input.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the expected result.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function does not overflow or encounter other numerical issues with large input values.

Scenario 5: Testing the function's update of input and output history
Details:
  TestName: test_process_updates_history
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly updates the input and output history.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values. Also, prepare a set of input values.
  Act: Invoke the process function sequentially with the set of input values.
  Assert: Check that the input_history and output_history attributes of the class instance correctly reflect the history of inputs and outputs.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function maintains an accurate history of inputs and outputs, as per the function's specifications.
