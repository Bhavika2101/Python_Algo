================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the type and value of 'sample', which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Add input validation checks for 'sample' to ensure it is a float and within expected range before processing.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code does not check if 'self.b_coeffs', 'self.a_coeffs', 'self.input_history', and 'self.output_history' are None before accessing them.
Solution: Add checks to ensure these member variables are not None before accessing them.

Vulnerability: CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
Issue: The code does not validate if 'self.order' is within the valid range of the arrays 'self.b_coeffs', 'self.a_coeffs', 'self.input_history', and 'self.output_history'.
Solution: Validate 'self.order' to ensure it doesn't exceed the length of the arrays.

Vulnerability: CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation
Issue: The result calculation doesn't handle the case when 'self.a_coeffs[0]' is zero, which could lead to a DivisionByZero error.
Solution: Add checks to ensure 'self.a_coeffs[0]' is not zero before dividing.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing with zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a zero input value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in 0 as the input value.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles zero input, as per the provided docstring example.

Scenario 2: Testing with non-zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_non_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a non-zero input value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a non-zero input value.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a non-zero result.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function properly calculates the result when given a non-zero input value, according to its internal logic.

Scenario 3: Testing with negative input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a negative input value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a negative input value.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a non-zero result.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles negative input values, as the internal logic involves both addition and multiplication of the input value.

Scenario 4: Testing the update of input and output history
Details:
  TestName: test_process_updates_input_and_output_history
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly updates the input and output history.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the process function with the appropriate order and coefficient values. Note the initial input and output history.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in an input value.
  Assert: Check that the input and output history have been updated with the new input and output values.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function maintains a correct history of input and output values, as this history is used in the calculation of future results.
