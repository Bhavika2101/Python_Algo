================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function process does not have any form of input validation for 'sample'. Malicious or incorrectly formatted inputs could lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement input validation for 'sample' to ensure it is of the correct type (float) and within an acceptable range if applicable.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The function uses the standard Python list for storing 'input_history' and 'output_history'. This could potentially lead to memory overflow issues if the list grows too large.
Solution: Consider using a data structure with a fixed size, such as collections.deque, to prevent memory overflow.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The function does not check if 'self.b_coeffs' and 'self.a_coeffs' are None before using them. This could lead to a TypeError if they are None.
Solution: Check if 'self.b_coeffs' and 'self.a_coeffs' are None before using them and handle the situation appropriately.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the process function with a zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly handles a zero input and returns a zero output as per the business logic encapsulated in the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the IIRFilter class and prepare the environment with the required coefficients and history.
  Act: Call the process function with a zero input.
  Assert: The expected outcome is zero, and this will be checked by comparing the function's return value with zero.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles and returns the expected output for zero inputs as per the specified business logic.

Scenario 2: Testing the process function with a non-zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_non_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly processes a non-zero input value and returns the expected output as per the business logic encapsulated in the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the IIRFilter class and prepare the environment with the required coefficients and history.
  Act: Call the process function with a non-zero input.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a non-zero output, and this will be checked by comparing the function's return value with the expected output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles and returns the expected output for non-zero inputs as per the specified business logic.

Scenario 3: Testing the process function with a negative input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly processes a negative input value and returns the expected output as per the business logic encapsulated in the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the IIRFilter class and prepare the environment with the required coefficients and history.
  Act: Call the process function with a negative input.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a non-zero output, and this will be checked by comparing the function's return value with the expected output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles and returns the expected output for negative inputs as per the specified business logic.

Scenario 4: Testing the process function with multiple sequential inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_sequential_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly processes multiple sequential inputs and returns the expected outputs as per the business logic encapsulated in the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the IIRFilter class and prepare the environment with the required coefficients and history.
  Act: Call the process function with multiple sequential inputs.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a series of outputs, and this will be checked by comparing the function's return values with the expected outputs.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles and returns the expected outputs for sequential inputs as per the specified business logic.
