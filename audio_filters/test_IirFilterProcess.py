Scenario 1: Validate the process of a zero sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_zero_sample
  Description: This test is intended to validate the process method when the sample is zero. The expected output should be zero as the sample and coefficients are all zeros.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order of 2.
  Act: Call the process method with the sample as 0.
  Assert: Check if the output is 0.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the base case where the input sample is zero. The expected result is zero which aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Validate the process of a non-zero sample with zero history
Details:
  TestName: test_process_non_zero_sample_with_zero_history
  Description: This test is intended to validate the process method when the sample is non-zero, but the history is still zero. The expected output should be the sample since all coefficients and history are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order of 2.
  Act: Call the process method with the sample as a non-zero value.
  Assert: Check if the output is equal to the sample.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the case where the input sample is non-zero but has no history. The expected result is the sample itself which aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Validate the process of a non-zero sample with non-zero history
Details:
  TestName: test_process_non_zero_sample_with_non_zero_history
  Description: This test is intended to validate the process method when the sample and history are both non-zero. The expected output should be a calculated float value based on the sample, coefficients, and history.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order of 2 and set the history and coefficients to non-zero values.
  Act: Call the process method with the sample as a non-zero value.
  Assert: Check if the output is the expected calculated float value.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the case where both the input sample and history are non-zero. The expected result is a calculated float value which aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 4: Validate the process of a non-zero sample with a change in order
Details:
  TestName: test_process_non_zero_sample_with_change_in_order
  Description: This test is intended to validate the process method when the order of the IIRFilter object changes. The expected output should be a calculated float value based on the sample, coefficients, and history.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with an order of 3 and set the history and coefficients to non-zero values.
  Act: Call the process method with the sample as a non-zero value.
  Assert: Check if the output is the expected calculated float value.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the case where the order of the IIRFilter object changes. The expected result is a calculated float value which aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.
