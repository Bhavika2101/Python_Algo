================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated inputs
Issue: The function make_lowshelf doesn't validate the input parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if incorrect values are passed.
Solution: Add validations for input parameters to ensure they are within acceptable ranges and of correct types.

Vulnerability: Missing error handling
Issue: The function make_lowshelf doesn't have any error handling mechanism. If an error occurs during the execution, the application may crash.
Solution: Add try/except blocks to catch and handle possible exceptions.

Vulnerability: Use of third-party package without validation
Issue: The code uses a third-party package 'audio_filters.iir_filter' without any validation. If this package has any vulnerabilities, it can affect the security of the whole application.
Solution: Validate the security of third-party packages before using them. Regularly update them to the latest versions to get security patches.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate low-shelf filter creation with positive gain.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_with_positive_gain
  Description: This test validates that the function make_lowshelf correctly creates a low-shelf filter when provided with positive gain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, and gain_db with appropriate values. Set gain_db to a positive number.
  Act: Call the function make_lowshelf with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter has the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the make_lowshelf function correctly handles positive gain values, which is a common use case in audio processing.

Scenario 2: Validate low-shelf filter creation with negative gain.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_with_negative_gain
  Description: This test validates that the function make_lowshelf correctly creates a low-shelf filter when provided with negative gain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, and gain_db with appropriate values. Set gain_db to a negative number.
  Act: Call the function make_lowshelf with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter has the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the make_lowshelf function can handle negative gain values, which is another common use case in audio processing.

Scenario 3: Validate low-shelf filter creation with zero gain.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_with_zero_gain
  Description: This test validates that the function make_lowshelf correctly creates a low-shelf filter when provided with zero gain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, and gain_db with appropriate values. Set gain_db to zero.
  Act: Call the function make_lowshelf with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter has the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the make_lowshelf function correctly handles zero gain, which represents a neutral audio filter.

Scenario 4: Validate low-shelf filter creation with maximum frequency.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_with_max_frequency
  Description: This test validates that the function make_lowshelf correctly creates a low-shelf filter when provided with the maximum allowable frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, and gain_db with appropriate values. Set frequency to its maximum allowable value.
  Act: Call the function make_lowshelf with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter has the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the make_lowshelf function can handle the maximum frequency, which represents the upper limit of the audio spectrum.

Scenario 5: Validate low-shelf filter creation with minimum frequency.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_lowshelf_with_min_frequency
  Description: This test validates that the function make_lowshelf correctly creates a low-shelf filter when provided with the minimum allowable frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, and gain_db with appropriate values. Set frequency to its minimum allowable value.
  Act: Call the function make_lowshelf with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter has the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the make_lowshelf function can handle the minimum frequency, which represents the lower limit of the audio spectrum.
