================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated inputs
Issue: The function make_highshelf takes several parameters but does not validate them. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if incorrect or malicious values are provided.
Solution: Add input validation checks to ensure that provided parameters are of the correct type and within expected ranges.

Vulnerability: Third-party package usage
Issue: The code uses the IIRFilter class from a third-party package. If this package has vulnerabilities, the code could be exploited.
Solution: Ensure the third-party package is kept up-to-date and check regularly for any reported vulnerabilities or updates.

Vulnerability: Potential for floating point errors
Issue: The code performs several mathematical operations that could result in floating point errors, leading to inaccurate results.
Solution: Consider using a library or package designed for high-precision mathematical operations, particularly when dealing with frequencies or other sensitive calculations.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with positive gain.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_positive_gain
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly creates a high-shelf filter when given a positive gain value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, gain_db and q_factor values with appropriate test data.
  Act: Call the make_highshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned IIRFilter object has the expected a_coeffs and b_coeffs values.
Validation:
  The test checks that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the mathematical formulas for creating a high-shelf filter with positive gain. This is crucial for ensuring accurate audio processing.

Scenario 2: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with negative gain.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_negative_gain
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly creates a high-shelf filter when given a negative gain value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, gain_db and q_factor values with appropriate test data.
  Act: Call the make_highshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned IIRFilter object has the expected a_coeffs and b_coeffs values.
Validation:
  The test checks that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the mathematical formulas for creating a high-shelf filter with negative gain. This is crucial for ensuring accurate audio processing.

Scenario 3: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with a q_factor other than the default.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_custom_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly creates a high-shelf filter when given a q_factor value other than the default.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, gain_db and q_factor values with appropriate test data.
  Act: Call the make_highshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned IIRFilter object has the expected a_coeffs and b_coeffs values.
Validation:
  The test checks that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the mathematical formulas for creating a high-shelf filter with a custom q_factor. This is crucial for ensuring accurate audio processing.

Scenario 4: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with frequency equal to samplerate.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_frequency_equals_samplerate
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly creates a high-shelf filter when the frequency is equal to the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, gain_db and q_factor values with frequency equal to samplerate.
  Act: Call the make_highshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned IIRFilter object has the expected a_coeffs and b_coeffs values.
Validation:
  The test checks that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the mathematical formulas for creating a high-shelf filter when the frequency equals the samplerate. This is an edge case that must be correctly handled to ensure accurate audio processing.

Scenario 5: Validate the error handling when frequency is greater than samplerate.
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_frequency_greater_than_samplerate
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles the error condition when the frequency is greater than the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, gain_db and q_factor values with frequency greater than samplerate.
  Act: Call the make_highshelf function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  The test checks that the make_highshelf function correctly handles error conditions, which is crucial for ensuring robust and reliable software.
