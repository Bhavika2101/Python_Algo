Scenario 1: Validating Correctness of High-shelf Filter Creation
Details:
  TestName: test_highshelf_filter_creation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-shelf filter is created correctly using valid parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the parameters frequency, samplerate, gain_db and q_factor with appropriate values.
  Act: Invoke the function make_highshelf with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the created filter's coefficients match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test is critical to ensure that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the business logic of creating a high-shelf filter. The expected result is directly linked to the function's specifications and mathematical calculations.

Scenario 2: Testing High-shelf Filter with Zero Gain
Details:
  TestName: test_highshelf_filter_zero_gain
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highshelf function when the gain_db parameter is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the parameters frequency, samplerate, and gain_db (set to zero), and q_factor with appropriate values.
  Act: Invoke the function make_highshelf with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the created filter's coefficients match the expected values for a filter with zero gain.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles the edge case of zero gain. The expected result is based on the mathematical properties of a high-shelf filter with zero gain.

Scenario 3: Testing High-shelf Filter with Negative Gain
Details:
  TestName: test_highshelf_filter_negative_gain
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highshelf function when the gain_db parameter is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the parameters frequency, samplerate, and gain_db (set to a negative value), and q_factor with appropriate values.
  Act: Invoke the function make_highshelf with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the created filter's coefficients match the expected values for a filter with negative gain.
Validation:
  This test is critical to ensure the function correctly handles the edge case of negative gain. The expected result is based on the mathematical properties of a high-shelf filter with negative gain.

Scenario 4: Testing High-shelf Filter with Exceptionally High Frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_highshelf_filter_high_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highshelf function when the frequency parameter is exceptionally high.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the parameters frequency (set to a very high value), samplerate, gain_db, and q_factor with appropriate values.
  Act: Invoke the function make_highshelf with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the created filter's coefficients match the expected values for a filter with high frequency.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles the edge case of high frequency. The expected result is based on the mathematical properties of a high-shelf filter with high frequency.

Scenario 5: Testing High-shelf Filter with Invalid Q Factor
Details:
  TestName: test_highshelf_filter_invalid_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highshelf function when the q_factor parameter is invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the parameters frequency, samplerate, gain_db, and q_factor (set to an invalid value) with appropriate values.
  Act: Invoke the function make_highshelf with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if an appropriate exception is thrown due to the invalid q_factor.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles the error condition of an invalid q_factor. The expected result is an exception, aligning with the function's specifications that mandate a valid q_factor.
