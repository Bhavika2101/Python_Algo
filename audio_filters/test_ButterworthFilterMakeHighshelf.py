================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated inputs (CWE-20)
Issue: The function make_highshelf accepts inputs but does not validate them. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the function is called with invalid arguments.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that frequency, samplerate, gain_db, and q_factor are all of the correct type and within expected ranges.

Vulnerability: Dependency Security (CWE-937)
Issue: The code relies on a third-party package, audio_filters, but there is no check for its secure version. This can lead to potential security risks if the package has known vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure that the latest secure version of the audio_filters package is being used. Regularly update dependencies and check for any known vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with standard parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_standard
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function make_highshelf correctly creates a high-shelf filter with standard parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with a frequency of 1000, a samplerate of 48000, and a gain_db of 6.
  Assert: The function should return an IIRFilter object with the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the business logic for creating a high-shelf filter with standard parameters. The expected result is connected to the function's specifications and business requirements by ensuring that the filter's coefficients match those of a correctly constructed high-shelf filter.

Scenario 2: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with a high Q factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_high_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function make_highshelf correctly creates a high-shelf filter when the Q factor is high.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with a frequency of 1000, a samplerate of 48000, a gain_db of 6, and a Q factor of 2.
  Assert: The function should return an IIRFilter object with the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the business logic for creating a high-shelf filter when the Q factor is high. The expected result is connected to the function's specifications and business requirements by ensuring that the filter's coefficients match those of a correctly constructed high-shelf filter.

Scenario 3: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with a negative gain
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_negative_gain
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function make_highshelf correctly creates a high-shelf filter when the gain is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with a frequency of 1000, a samplerate of 48000, and a gain_db of -6.
  Assert: The function should return an IIRFilter object with the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the business logic for creating a high-shelf filter when the gain is negative. The expected result is connected to the function's specifications and business requirements by ensuring that the filter's coefficients match those of a correctly constructed high-shelf filter.

Scenario 4: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with a zero Q factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_zero_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function make_highshelf correctly handles a case where the Q factor is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with a frequency of 1000, a samplerate of 48000, a gain_db of 6, and a Q factor of 0.
  Assert: The function should raise an exception, as a zero Q factor would cause a division by zero.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the make_highshelf function correctly handles invalid input. The expected result is connected to the function's specifications and business requirements by ensuring the function raises an exception when it encounters invalid input.
