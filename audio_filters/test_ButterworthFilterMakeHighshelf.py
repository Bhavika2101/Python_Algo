================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated inputs (CWE-20)
Issue: The function make_highshelf does not validate its inputs. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if incorrect values are provided, such as negative numbers or non-integer/float values.
Solution: Add checks at the beginning of the function to ensure that the provided values are of the expected type and within the expected range. For instance, you should ensure that frequency and samplerate are positive integers, and that gain_db and q_factor are floats.

Vulnerability: Insecure use of a third-party library (CWE-829)
Issue: The code uses a third-party library, audio_filters.iir_filter, but it does not check if the library is up-to-date or if it has any known security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Regularly update the third-party libraries used in your code. Use tools such as 'pip list --outdated' to check for outdated Python packages. Also, regularly check for any known security vulnerabilities in the libraries you use.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with standard parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_standard
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly creates a high-shelf filter when provided with standard parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency, samplerate, gain_db, and q_factor parameters.
  Act: Call make_highshelf function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter has the expected a_coeffs and b_coeffs values.
Validation:
  The test validates the core functionality of the make_highshelf function. The expected result is based on the mathematical model encapsulated by the function.

Scenario 2: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with maximum frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_max_frequency
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles the maximum possible frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency (as maximum possible), samplerate, gain_db, and q_factor parameters.
  Act: Call make_highshelf function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter has the expected a_coeffs and b_coeffs values.
Validation:
  Frequency is a key parameter in the function and the test verifies the function's behavior at the maximum possible value of frequency.

Scenario 3: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with minimum frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_min_frequency
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles the minimum possible frequency (i.e., zero).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency (as zero), samplerate, gain_db, and q_factor parameters.
  Act: Call make_highshelf function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter has the expected a_coeffs and b_coeffs values.
Validation:
  As frequency is a key parameter, the test verifies the function's behavior at the minimum possible value of frequency.

Scenario 4: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with maximum gain_db
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_max_gain_db
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles the maximum possible gain_db.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency, samplerate, gain_db (as maximum possible), and q_factor parameters.
  Act: Call make_highshelf function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter has the expected a_coeffs and b_coeffs values.
Validation:
  Gain_db is an important parameter in the function and the test verifies the function's behavior at the maximum possible value of gain_db.

Scenario 5: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with negative gain_db
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_negative_gain_db
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles a negative gain_db.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency, samplerate, gain_db (as a negative value), and q_factor parameters.
  Act: Call make_highshelf function with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter has the expected a_coeffs and b_coeffs values.
Validation:
  Gain_db is an important parameter in the function and the test verifies the function's behavior with a negative value of gain_db, representing a reduction in signal strength.
