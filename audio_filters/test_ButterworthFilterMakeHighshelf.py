================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated inputs (CWE-20)
Issue: The function make_highshelf does not validate its inputs. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if incorrect values are provided.
Solution: Add input validation checks to ensure that inputs are of the correct type and within expected ranges. For example, frequency and samplerate should be positive integers, gain_db should be a float, and q_factor should be a positive float.

Vulnerability: Insecure third-party package usage
Issue: The code uses the third-party package 'audio_filters.iir_filter'. If this package has vulnerabilities or is not maintained, it could pose a security risk.
Solution: Ensure that all third-party packages used in the code are secure, well-maintained, and trusted. Regularly check for updates and apply them to benefit from security patches.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with standard parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_standard
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function make_highshelf correctly creates a high-shelf filter with standard parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as this is a pure function.
  Act: Invoke the function make_highshelf with frequency=1000, samplerate=48000, and gain_db=6.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter has the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the business logic for creating a high-shelf filter with standard parameters. The expected result is based on the filter creation algorithm used in the function.

Scenario 2: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with a custom Q factor
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_custom_q_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function make_highshelf correctly creates a high-shelf filter with a custom Q factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as this is a pure function.
  Act: Invoke the function make_highshelf with frequency=1000, samplerate=48000, gain_db=6, and q_factor=1.5.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter has the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the business logic for creating a high-shelf filter with a custom Q factor. The expected result is based on the filter creation algorithm used in the function.

Scenario 3: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with a negative gain
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_negative_gain
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function make_highshelf correctly creates a high-shelf filter with a negative gain.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as this is a pure function.
  Act: Invoke the function make_highshelf with frequency=1000, samplerate=48000, and gain_db=-6.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter has the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the business logic for creating a high-shelf filter with a negative gain. The expected result is based on the filter creation algorithm used in the function.

Scenario 4: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with a frequency higher than the samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_high_frequency
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function make_highshelf correctly creates a high-shelf filter when the frequency is higher than the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as this is a pure function.
  Act: Invoke the function make_highshelf with frequency=50000, samplerate=48000, and gain_db=6.
  Assert: Check if the returned filter has the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the make_highshelf function correctly implements the business logic for creating a high-shelf filter when the frequency is higher than the samplerate. The expected result is based on the filter creation algorithm used in the function.
