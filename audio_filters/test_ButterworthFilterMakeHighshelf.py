================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The function 'make_highshelf' does not validate its input parameters. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if incorrect parameters are passed.
Solution: Implement checks to verify the input parameters. For instance, ensure 'frequency' and 'samplerate' are positive integers, 'gain_db' is a float, and 'q_factor' is a positive float.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Third-party Libraries (CWE-829)
Issue: The code imports 'IIRFilter' from 'audio_filters.iir_filter' but does not handle potential import errors. If the library is missing or has been tampered with, the code will fail in an uncontrolled manner.
Solution: Surround the import statement with a try/except block to handle import errors gracefully. Inform the user about the missing library and provide instructions for installing it.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with standard parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_standard
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly creates a high-shelf filter when provided with standard parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency, samplerate, gain_db, and q_factor variables with standard values.
  Act: Call the make_highshelf function with the defined variables.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and that the a_coeffs and b_coeffs properties match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly implements the business logic for creating a high-shelf filter with standard parameters, which is a core requirement of the filter creation process.

Scenario 2: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with maximum frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_max_frequency
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles the maximum possible frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency with a maximum value, and samplerate, gain_db, and q_factor with standard values.
  Act: Call the make_highshelf function with the defined variables.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and that the a_coeffs and b_coeffs properties match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the maximum possible frequency, which is an important edge case in the filter creation process.

Scenario 3: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with minimum frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_min_frequency
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles the minimum possible frequency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define frequency with a minimum value, and samplerate, gain_db, and q_factor with standard values.
  Act: Call the make_highshelf function with the defined variables.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and that the a_coeffs and b_coeffs properties match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the minimum possible frequency, which is an important edge case in the filter creation process.

Scenario 4: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with zero gain
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_zero_gain
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles a gain of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define gain_db with a value of zero, and frequency, samplerate, and q_factor with standard values.
  Act: Call the make_highshelf function with the defined variables.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and that the a_coeffs and b_coeffs properties match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles a gain of zero, which is a valid scenario in the filter creation process.

Scenario 5: Validate the creation of a high-shelf filter with negative gain
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highshelf_negative_gain
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highshelf function correctly handles a negative gain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define gain_db with a negative value, and frequency, samplerate, and q_factor with standard values.
  Act: Call the make_highshelf function with the defined variables.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and that the a_coeffs and b_coeffs properties match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles a negative gain, which is a valid scenario in the filter creation process.
