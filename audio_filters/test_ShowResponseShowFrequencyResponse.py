================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated User Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The function `show_frequency_response` doesn't validate or sanitize the input `filter_type` and `samplerate`. This could lead to unexpected behaviors or crashes if the input is not as expected.
Solution: Ensure to validate and sanitize the input to the function. Check that `filter_type` is an instance of the expected type and `samplerate` is a positive integer.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of External Library (CWE-1173)
Issue: The code uses `matplotlib.pyplot` and `numpy` libraries without checking for their secure configuration or validating their output. This could lead to unexpected results or security issues.
Solution: Ensure that the libraries are securely configured and their output is validated before use. Use only trusted sources for third-party libraries and regularly update them to the latest secure versions.

Vulnerability: Inadequate Logging (CWE-778)
Issue: The code is lacking proper error handling and logging. In case of errors or exceptions, there would be no trace of what went wrong, making it difficult to debug or identify potential security issues.
Solution: Implement proper error handling and logging. This will help to identify and fix issues quickly, and can provide valuable information in case of a security incident.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the frequency response with a valid filter and samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_valid_filter_and_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the business logic of the show_frequency_response function when provided with a valid filter and samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid filter and samplerate.
  Act: Invoke show_frequency_response function with the initialized filter and samplerate.
  Assert: The function should execute without throwing any exception and display the frequency response.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies that the function can correctly plot the frequency response for a given filter and samplerate. This is a critical functionality of the function as per its specifications.

Scenario 2: Validate the frequency response with a filter that returns zero outputs
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_zero_outputs_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify the business logic of the show_frequency_response function when provided with a filter that returns zero outputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter that returns zero outputs and a valid samplerate.
  Act: Invoke show_frequency_response function with the initialized filter and samplerate.
  Assert: The function should execute without throwing any exception and display the frequency response.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies that the function can correctly handle and plot the frequency response when the filter returns no outputs. This is an edge case that the function should be able to handle.

Scenario 3: Validate the frequency response with a very high samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_high_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the business logic of the show_frequency_response function when provided with a very high samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid filter and a very high samplerate.
  Act: Invoke show_frequency_response function with the initialized filter and samplerate.
  Assert: The function should execute without throwing any exception and display the frequency response.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies that the function can correctly handle and plot the frequency response when provided with a very high samplerate. This is an edge case that the function should be able to handle.

Scenario 4: Validate the frequency response with a negative samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_negative_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the show_frequency_response function when provided with a negative samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid filter and a negative samplerate.
  Act: Invoke show_frequency_response function with the initialized filter and samplerate.
  Assert: The function should throw an exception as samplerate should not be negative.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies that the function correctly handles invalid input and throws an exception when provided with a negative samplerate. This is a critical functionality of the function as per its specifications.
