================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: The code uses a user-supplied input in 'filter_type.process(item)' without sanitizing or validating it. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code.
Solution: Validate and sanitize user-supplied inputs before using them. Consider using Python's built-in libraries for input validation or third-party libraries such as 'cerberus'.

Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Memory Consumption
Issue: The code creates a large filler list with 'filler = [0] * (samplerate - size)'. If the 'samplerate' is a large number, this could lead to high memory consumption and potentially a Denial of Service (DoS).
Solution: Limit the size of user-supplied inputs. Consider using a strategy to handle large inputs such as streaming or pagination.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
Issue: The code does not include any logging or monitoring. This could make it harder to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
Solution: Add logging and monitoring to the application. Python's built-in 'logging' module can be used for this purpose.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify the function with valid FilterType and sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_valid_filter_and_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_frequency_response works correctly with valid FilterType and sample rate. The filter should process the input correctly and the frequency response should be displayed with the correct bounds.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid FilterType and sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the show_frequency_response function with the initialized FilterType and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function does not raise any exceptions and that the frequency response is displayed correctly.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly with valid inputs. The expected result is that the function should not raise any exceptions and the frequency response should be displayed correctly, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Verify the function with FilterType that has complex frequency response
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_complex_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_frequency_response can handle FilterType that has complex frequency response. The function should correctly process the input and display the frequency response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType that has complex frequency response.
  Act: Invoke the show_frequency_response function with the initialized FilterType.
  Assert: Check that the function does not raise any exceptions and that the frequency response is displayed correctly.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle complex frequency responses. The expected result is that the function should not raise any exceptions and the frequency response should be displayed correctly, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 3: Verify the function with very high sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_high_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_frequency_response can handle very high sample rates. The function should correctly process the input and display the frequency response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid FilterType and a very high sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the show_frequency_response function with the initialized FilterType and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function does not raise any exceptions and that the frequency response is displayed correctly.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle high sample rates. The expected result is that the function should not raise any exceptions and the frequency response should be displayed correctly, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 4: Verify the function with low sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_low_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function show_frequency_response can handle low sample rates. The function should correctly process the input and display the frequency response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid FilterType and a low sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the show_frequency_response function with the initialized FilterType and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function does not raise any exceptions and that the frequency response is displayed correctly.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle low sample rates. The expected result is that the function should not raise any exceptions and the frequency response should be displayed correctly, as per the function's specifications.
