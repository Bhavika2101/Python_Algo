================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Memory Consumption CWE-400
Issue: The code creates list objects (`inputs`, `outputs`) which can grow significantly, and consume memory, if the parameters `size` and `samplerate` are very large. This can lead to Denial-of-service (DoS).
Solution: Introduce pre-condition checks to avoid creating large list objects. Limit the values that variables like `size` and `samplerate` can take to avoid excessive memory usage.

Vulnerability: Insecure use of External Libraries CWE-829
Issue: The code uses external Python libraries numpy and matplotlib that can have potential security risks if they are outdated or not properly configured. This can result in various attacks from unauthorized code execution to sensitive information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure that the external libraries used by your code are the latest stable versions and are used in a secure manner, adhering to individual library's best practices.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The code calls `process` method on the `filter_type` object directly without validating if the passed `filter_type` instance actually has that attribute/method. This can result in AttributeError, leading to interruption of the service.
Solution: Before calling the method `process`, verify if the instance actually has that attribute using hasattr() function. Handle such cases properly to avoid disruption of service.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with valid filter type and sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_valid_inputs
  Description: This test verifies that the function show_frequency_response works correctly given a valid filter type and sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid filter type and sample rate. 
  Act: Call show_frequency_response function with the initialized filter type and sample rate.
  Assert: Check if the function generates the expected plot and no errors are thrown.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: The test checks if the function correctly plots the frequency response of a filter. A correct plot verifies that the mathematical operations and graph plotting work as expected.

Scenario 2: Recall the function with different frequency responses
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_for_varying_responses
  Description: This test ensures that the function show_frequency_response can handle different frequency responses, i.e., it is sensitive to the changes in input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare different filter types.
  Act: Call the function with the different filter types
  Assert: Confirm that different plots, corresponding to the given filter types, are produced.
Validation:
  Rationale: The test verifies the function's responsiveness to changes in input. This is an essential aspect of the function as it should represent the different frequency responses of diverse types of filters.

Scenario 3: Test for accuracy of frequency range 
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_range_accuracy
  Description: This test is designed to ensure the correct frequency range is displayed on the x-axis of the plot
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid filter type and sample rate. 
  Act: Call show_frequency_response function with the initialized filter type and sample rate.
  Assert: Check if the plot's frequency range is between 24 to Nyquist frequency (samplerate/2 - 1)
Validation: 
  Rationalize the importance of the test: The test checks that the frequency range displayed on the plot is correct, which is important to accurately represent the frequency response. 

Scenario 4: Test for display gain bounds
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_display_bounds
  Description: This test checks if the gain bounds of the plot are correctly displayed within [-80, 80] dB
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the filter type and sample rate.
  Act: Call the show_frequency_response function.
  Assert: Verify if the gain bounds on the plot are within the expected range.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: Ensure the display bounds are set correctly would provide the ability to visualize the gain range appropriately.

Scenario 5: Test for Zero-Padding Size
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_zero_padding
  Description: The test verifies whether the size of zero-padding is appropriate (samplerate-size).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid filter type and sample rate.
  Act: Call show_frequency_response function with the initialized filter type and sample rate.
  Assert: Check if the provided outputs are appended with the correct size of zero-padding.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: The right size of the zero-padding ensure the correct size of the FFT input, and therefore, the correctness of frequency response.
