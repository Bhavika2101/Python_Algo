================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The method 'show_frequency_response' does not validate the 'filter_type' parameter. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if an incorrect or malicious object is passed.
Solution: Verify that 'filter_type' is of the expected type and has the required 'process' method before using it.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Third-Party Libraries (CWE-829)
Issue: The code uses 'numpy' and 'matplotlib.pyplot' libraries without checking their versions. If outdated or compromised versions of these libraries are installed, it may lead to security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure that the latest, secure versions of 'numpy' and 'matplotlib.pyplot' are being used. You can enforce this by specifying the minimum required versions in your project's dependencies.

Vulnerability: Potential Denial of Service (CWE-400)
Issue: The 'show_frequency_response' method could potentially consume a lot of memory if the 'samplerate' parameter is very large, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Add checks to ensure that the 'samplerate' parameter is within a reasonable range and does not lead to excessive memory usage.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the frequency response with a valid filter and samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_valid_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' correctly generates the frequency response for a given filter and sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object and a valid sample rate.
  Act: Call the function 'show_frequency_response' with the filter object and sample rate as parameters.
  Assert: There is no assertion as the function does not return any value, but the test should pass if no exceptions are thrown during the execution.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly generate the frequency response for a valid filter and sample rate. The expected result is that no exceptions are thrown, indicating that the function is correctly processing the inputs and generating the frequency response.

Scenario 2: Validate the frequency response with a very high samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_high_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' can handle a high sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object and a very high sample rate.
  Act: Call the function 'show_frequency_response' with the filter object and high sample rate as parameters.
  Assert: There is no assertion as the function does not return any value, but the test should pass if no exceptions are thrown during the execution.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle high sample rates. The expected result is that no exceptions are thrown, indicating that the function is correctly processing the inputs and generating the frequency response, even with high sample rates.

Scenario 3: Validate the frequency response with a zero samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_zero_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' can handle a zero sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object and a zero sample rate.
  Act: Call the function 'show_frequency_response' with the filter object and zero sample rate as parameters.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown, as the sample rate cannot be zero.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles invalid input. The expected result is that an exception is thrown, indicating that the function correctly identifies the invalid input and does not attempt to generate a frequency response with a zero sample rate.
