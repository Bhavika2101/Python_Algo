================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The method 'show_frequency_response' does not validate the 'filter_type' parameter. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if an incorrect or malicious object is passed.
Solution: Verify that 'filter_type' is of the expected type and has a 'process' method before using it. This can be done using the 'isinstance' function and the 'hasattr' function.

Vulnerability: Uncaught Exceptions (CWE-390)
Issue: The code does not handle exceptions that could be raised by the 'np.log10' function when its input contains zero or negative values. This could cause the application to crash.
Solution: Wrap the call to 'np.log10' in a try/except block and handle the exception appropriately.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Third-Party Libraries (CWE-829)
Issue: The code uses the 'matplotlib.pyplot' and 'numpy' libraries without any checks on their versions. Using outdated or compromised versions of these libraries could introduce security vulnerabilities into the application.
Solution: Ensure that the application is using the latest and secure versions of these libraries. This can be done by specifying the versions in the project's requirements file.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the frequency response with a valid filter and samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_valid_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' correctly generates the frequency response for a given filter and sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object and a valid sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the function 'show_frequency_response' with the filter object and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function executes without error and generates a plot.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function can handle valid inputs as expected and generate the correct frequency response. 

Scenario 2: Validate the frequency response with a zero sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_zero_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' correctly handles the case when the sample rate is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object and a sample rate equal to zero.
  Act: Invoke the function 'show_frequency_response' with the filter object and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function executes without error and generates a plot with the x-axis limit set to [24, 0].
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle edge cases correctly, such as a zero sample rate, without crashing or producing incorrect results.

Scenario 3: Validate the frequency response with a negative sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_negative_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' correctly handles the case when the sample rate is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object and a negative sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the function 'show_frequency_response' with the filter object and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a ValueError as negative sample rates are not valid.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle invalid inputs correctly and raise the appropriate exceptions. 

Scenario 4: Validate the frequency response with a large sample rate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_large_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' can handle large sample rates without crashing or producing incorrect results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object and a large sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the function 'show_frequency_response' with the filter object and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function executes without error and generates a plot.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function can handle large inputs correctly and efficiently. 

Scenario 5: Validate the frequency response with a null filter
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_null_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' correctly handles the case when the filter object is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a null filter object and a valid sample rate.
  Act: Invoke the function 'show_frequency_response' with the null filter object and sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a TypeError as null filters are not valid.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle invalid inputs correctly and raise the appropriate exceptions.
