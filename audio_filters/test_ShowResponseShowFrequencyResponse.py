Scenario 1: Verify correct frequency response of the filter
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_correctness
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly processes the inputs and shows the frequency response of the filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter, set the sample rate, and prepare the expected frequency response data.
  Act: Call the show_frequency_response function with the initialized filter and sample rate.
  Assert: Plot the expected frequency response data and compare it with the output plot of the function.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the correctness of the function. The expected output is based on the known behavior of the filter and sample rate.

Scenario 2: Verify that the function handles small sample rates correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_small_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function can handle small sample rates without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter and set a small sample rate.
  Act: Call the show_frequency_response function with the initialized filter and small sample rate.
  Assert: Check if the function completes without errors and produces a valid output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function's robustness. The function should be able to handle small sample rates without failing.

Scenario 3: Verify that the function handles large sample rates correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_large_sample_rate
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function can handle large sample rates without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter and set a large sample rate.
  Act: Call the show_frequency_response function with the initialized filter and large sample rate.
  Assert: Check if the function completes without errors and produces a valid output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function's robustness. The function should be able to handle large sample rates without failing.

Scenario 4: Verify that the function handles different types of filters correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_different_filters
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function can handle different types of filters without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize different types of filters and set a sample rate.
  Act: Call the show_frequency_response function with each filter and the sample rate.
  Assert: Check if the function completes without errors and produces a valid output for each filter.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function's versatility. The function should be able to handle different types of filters without failing.
  
Scenario 5: Verify that the function handles zero-padding correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_zero_padding
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly pads zeros to the outputs when the sample rate is larger than the size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter and set a sample rate larger than the size.
  Act: Call the show_frequency_response function with the filter and the sample rate.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly pads zeros to the outputs.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the correctness of the function. The function should correctly pad zeros to the outputs when the sample rate is larger than the size.
