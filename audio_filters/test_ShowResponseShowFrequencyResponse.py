================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The method 'show_frequency_response' does not validate the 'filter_type' and 'samplerate' inputs. This can lead to potential runtime errors or malicious exploitation if manipulated inputs are provided.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure 'filter_type' is of expected type and 'samplerate' is a positive integer.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of External Libraries (CWE-1174)
Issue: The code uses 'numpy' and 'matplotlib.pyplot' libraries without any version control. It may lead to security vulnerabilities if outdated or insecure versions of these libraries are used.
Solution: Ensure that secure and updated versions of 'numpy' and 'matplotlib.pyplot' are used. Consider using a package manager like pipenv to lock the versions of these libraries.

Vulnerability: Potential Denial of Service (CWE-400)
Issue: The 'show_frequency_response' function could be susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if a large 'samplerate' value is provided, as it creates a list of zeros of size 'samplerate - size'. This could exhaust the memory resources.
Solution: Implement a check to limit the size of 'samplerate' to prevent excessive memory consumption.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the frequency response with a valid filter and samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_valid_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' correctly generates the frequency response for a given filter and sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object and a valid sample rate.
  Act: Call the function 'show_frequency_response' with the filter object and sample rate as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function correctly generates the frequency response without any errors.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to ensure that the function can generate the expected frequency response for valid input parameters. This is a core functionality of the function and is crucial for the business logic.

Scenario 2: Validate the handling of zero-padding
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_zero_padding
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' correctly handles zero-padding when the sample rate is greater than the size of the input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object and a sample rate that is greater than the size of the input.
  Act: Call the function 'show_frequency_response' with the filter object and sample rate as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function correctly generates the frequency response without any errors, and that the zero-padding is correctly applied.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to ensure that the function can handle zero-padding correctly. This is a necessary part of the frequency response calculation and is crucial for the business logic.

Scenario 3: Validate the handling of the log scale frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_log_scale
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' correctly handles the log scale frequency when plotting the frequency response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object and a valid sample rate.
  Act: Call the function 'show_frequency_response' with the filter object and sample rate as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function correctly generates the frequency response without any errors, and that the frequency is displayed on a log scale.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly display the frequency on a log scale. This is a necessary part of the frequency response visualization and is crucial for the business logic.

Scenario 4: Validate the handling of gain bounds
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_gain_bounds
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' correctly handles the gain bounds when plotting the frequency response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object and a valid sample rate.
  Act: Call the function 'show_frequency_response' with the filter object and sample rate as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function correctly generates the frequency response without any errors, and that the gain is displayed within the correct bounds.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly handle the gain bounds. This is a necessary part of the frequency response visualization and is crucial for the business logic.
