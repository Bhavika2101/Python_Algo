================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The method 'show_frequency_response' does not validate the 'filter_type' and 'samplerate' inputs. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the inputs are not of the expected type or value.
Solution: Implement input validation for 'filter_type' and 'samplerate'. Ensure 'filter_type' is an instance of the expected class and 'samplerate' is a positive integer.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of External Library (CWE-1173)
Issue: The 'matplotlib.pyplot' and 'numpy' libraries are used without any checks for their secure configuration or safe use. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in these libraries can lead to security issues.
Solution: Ensure the latest secure versions of these libraries are used, and follow best practices for their use.

Vulnerability: Insecure Temporary File (CWE-377)
Issue: The 'show_frequency_response' method may generate plots that are saved as temporary files. If the file names are predictable or the files are not securely deleted, they could be accessed by unauthorized users.
Solution: Use secure methods for generating temporary files, such as 'tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile', and ensure files are securely deleted after use.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the frequency response with a valid filter and samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_valid_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function 'show_frequency_response' correctly generates the frequency response for a given valid filter and samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid filter and a samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function 'show_frequency_response' with the initialized filter and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function executes without any errors and generates a frequency response.
Validation:
  This test is important as it validates the core functionality of the function 'show_frequency_response'. The expected result is that the function generates a frequency response without any errors, which aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Validate the behavior of the function with a zero samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_zero_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when a zero samplerate is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid filter and a samplerate of zero.
  Act: Invoke the function 'show_frequency_response' with the initialized filter and zero samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an exception or error due to the zero samplerate.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's robustness and error handling capabilities. The expected result is that the function raises an exception or error, which aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Validate the behavior of the function with a negative samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_negative_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when a negative samplerate is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid filter and a negative samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function 'show_frequency_response' with the initialized filter and negative samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an exception or error due to the negative samplerate.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's robustness and error handling capabilities. The expected result is that the function raises an exception or error, which aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 4: Validate the behavior of the function with a large samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_large_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when a large samplerate is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid filter and a large samplerate.
  Act: Invoke the function 'show_frequency_response' with the initialized filter and large samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the function executes without any errors and generates a frequency response.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's ability to handle large values. The expected result is that the function generates a frequency response without any errors, which aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.
