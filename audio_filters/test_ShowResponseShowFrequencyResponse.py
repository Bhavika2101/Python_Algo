================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The filter_type and samplerate parameters of the show_frequency_response() function do not have clear input validation. This can lead to unexpected behavior, possible errors, and security vulnerabilities if incorrect or malicious parameters are passed.
Solution: Use Python's built-in functions and libraries to validate inputs before using them. For example, validate that filter_type is an instance of a viable type and that samplerate is a positive integer.

Vulnerability: Potential Denial of Service (CWE-400)
Issue: The piece of code includes an array which size equals to the samplerate value providing by the user. If the samplerate value was very large, it could end up consuming extensive resources and potentially cause a system slow down or even a crash.
Solution: Implement limits on the size of the input and enforce them at the beginning of the function. This will prevent potential DOS attacks.

Vulnerability: Missing Error Handling Mechanism (CWE-703)
Issue: The code does not handle any exceptions that may occur during its execution. For example, the np.log10() function can raise a ValueError if given a negative number.
Solution: Surround blocks of code that may raise exceptions with try/except blocks and handle errors gracefully.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test frequency response of filter
Details:
  TestName: test_frequency_response_of_filter
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates and displays the frequency response of a provided filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a suitable filter and samplerate.
  Act: Use the show_frequency_response() function with the created filter and samplerate.
  Assert: No assertions can be made as the function outputs through matplotlib plot, a visual representation. Ensure that the program doesn't throw any exceptions.
Validation: 
  The test is crucial to ensure that the frequency response displayed is correctly calculated from the given filter and samplerate. The expected result has no side effects, so it should run without exceptions.

Scenario 2: Test function with minimal samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_minimal_samplerate
  Description: This test checks if the function handles a minimal samplerate correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter and set samplerate to the lowest possible valid integer.
  Act: Call the show_frequency_response() function with the created filter and minimal samplerate.
  Assert: No assertions can be made as the function is intended for visual representation. Ensure that the program doesn't throw any exceptions.
Validation: 
  This test assures that the method can handle a minimal samplerate without crashing, which is important for the robustness of the code.

Scenario 3: Test function with a maximum samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_maximal_samplerate
  Description: This test checks if the function copes with a maximum samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter and set samplerate to the highest possible valid integer.
  Act: Call the show_frequency_response() function with the created filter and maximum samplerate.
  Assert: No assertions can be made as the function is intended for visual representation. Ensure that the program doesn't throw any exceptions.
Validation: 
  The objective of this test is to verify the method's ability to handle a high samplerate value, ensuring its robustness and consistency even with the upper edge values.

Scenario 4: Test function with negative or zero samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_samplerates
  Description: This test checks how the function handles invalid samplerates (negative or zero).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter and set samplerate to either zero or a negative number.
  Act: Call the show_frequency_response() function with the created filter and invalid samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the function raises an appropriate exception.
Validation: 
  This test is important for verifying the method's robustness and how it behaves with invalid values - it should fail gracefully; in this case, by raising an expected exception.

Scenario 5: Test show_frequency_response without filter
Details:
  TestName: test_no_filter_provided
  Description: This test checks how the function behaves when no filter is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set filter to be None and define any valid samplerate.
  Act: Call the show_frequency_response() function with the filter set to None and the valid samplerate.
  Assert: Check if the function raises an appropriate exception.
Validation: 
  This test is essential to verify the method's reaction to lack of filter - it should fail gracefully, raising an expected exception. It ensures the function maintains its contract of guaranteeing valid inputs.
