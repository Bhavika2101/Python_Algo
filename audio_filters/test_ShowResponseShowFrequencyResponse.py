================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Dependency on external dependencies
Issue: The script relies heavily on third-party packages such as matplotlib and numpy. These packages may cause the script to execute arbitrary code if any of the dependencies have been maliciously tampered with.
Solution: Review the reliability and security practices of third-party packages before use. Make sure you are downloading packages from a trusted source like PyPI and regularly check for package updates

Vulnerability: Input validation issue
Issue: At the beginning of the show_frequency_response function, there is no check to see if the filter_type provided is a valid type. This results in a potential for TypeError if an invalid filter_type is provided.
Solution: Add checks at the beginning of the function to make sure the filter_type parameter is of a valid type. Raise an appropriate error message if the argument fails the check.

Vulnerability: Input validation issue
Issue: In the show_frequency_response function, the function lacks error handling code to check whether 'samplerate' is a positive integer. It's a potential risk, because if it's not a positive integer, the script will break.
Solution: Validate the 'samplerate' input to ensure it's a positive integer before using it.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate frequency response of a valid IIRFilter
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_iir_filter
  Description: Validates that the function show_frequency_response correctly generates freqency response of a valid IIRFilter instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid IIRFilter instance. Defining a fixed low samplerate.
  Act: Invoke show_frequency_response with the initialized filter and samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the output (a plot) has been generated which follows the specifications correctly such as axes labeling, frequency boundaries and gain boundaries.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Making sure that the method works correctly with valid IIRFilter instances is crucial as it lies in normal method operations. This verifies that under normal conditions, the method behaves as expected.

Scenario 2: Validate boundary conditions for frequency response plot
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_boundary_conditions
  Description: Validates that the function show_frequency_response adheres to specified boundary conditions for frequency and gain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid IIRFilter instance. Define a high samplerate in order to push the frequency limit.
  Act: Invoke show_frequency_response with the initialized filter and high samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the output (a plot) frequency lies between 24 and samplerate/2-1 and gain lies between -80dB and 80dB as prescribed.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Validating boundary conditions and tolerances is important as it ensures the method behaves as expected while pushing against its specifications.

Scenario 3: Validate response to different filter types
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_different_filters
  Description: Validates that the function show_frequency_response can handle different types of filters and correctly generate their frequency responses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize multiple valid filter instances (IIR, FIR, etc).
  Act: Invoke show_frequency_response with each different filter type.
  Assert: Check that the output (a plot) accurately represents the frequency response of each filter type.
Validation:
  Rationalize: It's important to ensure the method's compatibility with different filter types, which may have varied characteristics.

Scenario 4: Validate handling of small samplerates preventing plot generation
Details:
  TestName: test_show_frequency_response_small_samplerate
  Description: Validates that the function show_frequency_response can handle small samplerate values that might prevent the plot from being generated correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid IIRFilter instance. Define a very small samplerate near to the lower boundary in order to test for handling small values.
  Act: Invoke show_frequency_response with the filter and small samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the output (a plot) don't breach the lower limit and is generated as expected.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The choice of samplerate should not prevent the plot from being displayed correctly. The method should appropriately limit and handle all valid input values.
