================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Import
Issue: The code imports several modules without controlling or verifying the sources. This could lead to potential security risks if a malicious module is imported.
Solution: Always ensure the modules you are importing are from trusted sources. You can use virtual environments to isolate your project and control the packages that you import.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Input Validation
Issue: The function process() does not validate the input 'sample'. This could lead to potential security risks if an unexpected or malicious input is provided.
Solution: Always validate, sanitize and limit the type and size of the input that your function is receiving to prevent any potential security risks.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Python Protocol
Issue: The code checks if FilterType is a subclass of Protocol, but FilterType is not defined anywhere in the code. This could potentially lead to runtime errors.
Solution: Ensure that you define all classes and variables before using them. This will prevent potential runtime errors and security risks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for positive float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for a positive float input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a positive float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and matches the expected output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles positive float inputs, which is a primary use case for this function.

Scenario 2: Test for zero float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for a zero float input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with zero float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and matches the expected output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles zero float inputs, as zero is a special case that can sometimes cause issues in calculations.

Scenario 3: Test for negative float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for a negative float input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a negative float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and matches the expected output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles negative float inputs, which is a less common but still valid use case for this function.

Scenario 4: Test for extremely large float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for a very large float input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a very large float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and matches the expected output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle inputs of any magnitude, as this is a requirement for a robust mathematical function.

Scenario 5: Test for extremely small float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_small_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for a very small float input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a very small float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and matches the expected output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle inputs of any magnitude, as this is a requirement for a robust mathematical function.
