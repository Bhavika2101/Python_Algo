================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Import
Issue: The code imports several modules without checking their authenticity or integrity. This could lead to the import of malicious modules.
Solution: Ensure that imported modules are from trusted sources, and consider using a package manager to automatically handle this.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Abstract Method
Issue: The process method in the code is an abstract method. If a class inherits from this protocol and does not implement this method, it could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.
Solution: Ensure that all classes that inherit from this protocol implement the process method.

Vulnerability: Potential Code Injection
Issue: The use of input parameters in the 'process' function could potentially open up risks of code injection if not properly sanitized.
Solution: Ensure that all inputs are properly sanitized and validated before use.

Vulnerability: Use of Deprecated Python Constructs
Issue: The code uses 'from __future__ import annotations' which is now standard in Python 3.7 and later. It's not a security issue per se, but it's good practice to remove deprecated constructs.
Solution: Remove the 'from __future__ import annotations' as it's not necessary in Python 3.7 and later.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validating the process method with positive float value
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_float
  Description: This test verifies that the process method correctly calculates y[n] when a positive float is passed as the sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a positive float value.
  Act: Invoke the process method on the FilterType object, passing the positive float value.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a float and is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the process method correctly handles positive float values, which is a common use case in the application.

Scenario 2: Validating the process method with negative float value
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_float
  Description: This test verifies that the process method correctly calculates y[n] when a negative float is passed as the sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a negative float value.
  Act: Invoke the process method on the FilterType object, passing the negative float value.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a float and is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the process method correctly handles negative float values, which is a common use case in the application.

Scenario 3: Validating the process method with zero
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the process method correctly calculates y[n] when zero is passed as the sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a zero value.
  Act: Invoke the process method on the FilterType object, passing the zero value.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a float and is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the process method correctly handles zero, which is a common use case in the application.

Scenario 4: Validating the process method with large float values
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_float
  Description: This test verifies that the process method correctly calculates y[n] when a large float value is passed as the sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a large float value.
  Act: Invoke the process method on the FilterType object, passing the large float value.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a float and is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the process method can handle large float values, which could be a potential edge case in the application.

Scenario 5: Validating the process method with small float values
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_small_float
  Description: This test verifies that the process method correctly calculates y[n] when a small float value is passed as the sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and a small float value.
  Act: Invoke the process method on the FilterType object, passing the small float value.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a float and is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the process method can handle small float values, which could be a potential edge case in the application.
