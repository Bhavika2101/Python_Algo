Scenario 1: Calculate Y[n] using a valid sample
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_y_for_valid_sample
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the value of Y[n] when provided with a valid input sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the input sample with a valid value.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in the initialized input sample.
  Assert: Check if the returned output is a float.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This is the base functional requirement of the process function. Therefore, this test will ensure if the function behaves as expected when given correct inputs.

Scenario 2: Calculate Y[n] using a zero 
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_y_for_zero_sample
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the function process when provided with a zero value input sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the input sample with value zero.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in the initialized input sample.
  Assert: Check if the returned output is as expected (depends on the business rule for handling zero).
Validation:
  Rationalize: In some mathematical calculations, using zero as a sample could result in unexpected or undefined results, this test will ensure that the function handles zero correctly or returns a reasonable output.

Scenario 3: Validate handling of extremely large sample values
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_y_for_large_sample
  Description: This test intends to verify the function's ability to handle large sample values without running into overflow or inaccuracies.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the input sample with a very large value.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing the initialized input sample.
  Assert: Check if the returned output is valid and does not lead to an overflow.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Very large inputs could cause overflow issues in some mathematical calculations, hence it's important to ensure the function can handle such values correctly.

Scenario 4: Negative Sample Values
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_y_for_negative_sample
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles negative samples.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the input sample with a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in the initialized input sample.
  Assert: Check if the returned output is correct based on the desired mathematical procedure for handling negative samples.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the process function correctly handles negative inputs, as real-world scenarios can involve negative float values as valid inputs.

Note: The expected outcome and way to handle edge cases will depend on the underlying business logic and mathematical model, which have not been provided so taking generically.
