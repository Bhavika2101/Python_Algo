ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=process_5af1487270

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The function 'process' is not encapsulated within any class or module, which can expose it to misuse or exploitation.
Solution: Encapsulate the 'process' function within a class or module to limit its scope and accessibility.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The use of 'from __future__ import annotations' can lead to compatibility issues with older versions of Python, and potential misuse by malicious actors.
Solution: Ensure backward compatibility by avoiding use of '__future__' imports when possible, or by clearly documenting its use and potential issues.

Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: The use of docstrings for testing ('issubclass(FilterType, Protocol)') can potentially expose sensitive information in logs.
Solution: Avoid writing sensitive information in docstrings, and neutralize output for logs.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The import statement ('from abc import abstractmethodfrom math import pi') is malformed, which can cause an error message exposing sensitive information.
Solution: Correct the import statement to 'from abc import abstractmethod' and 'from math import pi' on separate lines to prevent error messages.

```
Scenario 1: Validate the process function with a positive floating point number
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_float
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly calculates y[n] when given a positive floating point number as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the process function does not depend on any external state.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a positive floating point number.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and is correctly calculated based on the input.
Validation:
  Rationale: The process function is expected to handle positive floating point numbers as input. This test verifies that it does so correctly.

Scenario 2: Validate the process function with a negative floating point number
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_float
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly calculates y[n] when given a negative floating point number as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the process function does not depend on any external state.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a negative floating point number.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and is correctly calculated based on the input.
Validation:
  Rationale: The process function is expected to handle negative floating point numbers as input. This test verifies that it does so correctly.

Scenario 3: Validate the process function with zero as input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly calculates y[n] when given zero as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the process function does not depend on any external state.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in zero.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and is correctly calculated based on the input.
Validation:
  Rationale: The process function is expected to handle zero as input. This test verifies that it does so correctly.

Scenario 4: Validate the process function with a very large floating point number
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_float
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the process function correctly calculates y[n] when given a very large floating point number as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the process function does not depend on any external state.
  Act: Invoke the process function, passing in a very large floating point number.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and is correctly calculated based on the input.
Validation:
  Rationale: The process function is expected to handle very large floating point numbers as input. This test verifies that it does so correctly.
