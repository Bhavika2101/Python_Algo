================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Import
Issue: The code imports several modules without checking their integrity, which can lead to the execution of malicious code if the modules are tampered with.
Solution: Use a package manager that supports dependency checking and integrity checks, such as pipenv or poetry, to install and manage third-party packages.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Load
Issue: The numpy package is imported but not used, which can lead to unnecessary security risks if numpy's load function is used insecurely elsewhere.
Solution: Only import the necessary packages and always use secure functions to load data. If numpy's load function is used elsewhere, ensure it's used with 'allow_pickle=False' to prevent arbitrary code execution.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Input Validation
Issue: The function 'process' does not validate its input, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Validate the input of 'process' to ensure it is a float and within the expected range.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validating the process method with positive float value
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_float
  Description: This test verifies that the process method correctly calculates y[n] when a positive float is passed as the sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and define a positive float as the sample.
  Act: Invoke the process method, passing the positive float as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a float and matches the expected calculation for y[n].
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as it validates the basic functionality of the process method with a common input type. It ensures that the method correctly implements the mathematical calculation for y[n] as per the business requirements.

Scenario 2: Validating the process method with zero as input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the process method correctly handles the edge case when zero is passed as the sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and define zero as the sample.
  Act: Invoke the process method, passing zero as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a float and matches the expected calculation for y[n].
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as it verifies the method's ability to handle edge cases. It ensures that the calculation for y[n] is correctly implemented even when the input is zero, as per the business requirements.

Scenario 3: Validating the process method with negative float value
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_float
  Description: This test verifies that the process method correctly calculates y[n] when a negative float is passed as the sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and define a negative float as the sample.
  Act: Invoke the process method, passing the negative float as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a float and matches the expected calculation for y[n].
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the process method correctly handles negative float inputs. It is important to ensure that the method can handle a full range of valid float inputs, including negative values.

Scenario 4: Validating the process method with extremely large float value
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_float
  Description: This test verifies that the process method can handle and correctly calculates y[n] when an extremely large float is passed as the sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a FilterType object and define an extremely large float as the sample.
  Act: Invoke the process method, passing the large float as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a float and matches the expected calculation for y[n].
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as it verifies the method's ability to handle extreme cases. It ensures that the calculation for y[n] is correctly implemented even when the input is extremely large, as per the business requirements.
