================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Import
Issue: The code imports several modules without controlling or verifying the sources. This could lead to potential security risks if a malicious module is imported.
Solution: Ensure all imported modules are from trusted sources. Consider using a virtual environment to isolate your application and its dependencies from the global Python environment.

Vulnerability: Unused Imports
Issue: The code imports modules 'abc', 'math', and 'typing' that are not used in the code. This could lead to unnecessary memory consumption and potential security risks if these modules have vulnerabilities.
Solution: Remove unused imports from the code to reduce the attack surface and improve the performance of the application.

Vulnerability: Insecure use of third-party packages
Issue: The code uses 'matplotlib' and 'numpy' packages without checking their versions or sources. This could lead to potential security risks if the packages have known vulnerabilities.
Solution: Always use the latest and secure versions of third-party packages. Verify the source of these packages and check for any known vulnerabilities before using them in your application.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for positive float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for a positive float input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a positive float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned output is a float and is correctly calculated.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles positive float inputs, which is a primary use case for this function.

Scenario 2: Test for zero float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for a zero float input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a zero float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned output is a float and is correctly calculated.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles zero float inputs, which is an edge case for this function.

Scenario 3: Test for negative float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for a negative float input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a negative float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned output is a float and is correctly calculated.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles negative float inputs, which is an edge case for this function.

Scenario 4: Test for large float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for a large float input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a large float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned output is a float and is correctly calculated.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles large float inputs, which is an edge case for this function.
