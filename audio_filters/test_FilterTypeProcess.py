Scenario 1: Correct output for positive sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_positive_sample
  Description: This test verifies that the process function correctly calculates y[n] for a positive sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive float sample.
  Act: Call the process function with the sample as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the output is a float and the calculation is correct according to the function logic.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function works correctly with positive samples, which is a common use case.

Scenario 2: Correct output for zero sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_zero_sample
  Description: This test verifies that the process function correctly calculates y[n] for a sample of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a sample with a value of zero.
  Act: Call the process function with the sample as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the output is a float and the calculation is correct according to the function logic.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function works correctly with a sample of zero, which is an edge case that could potentially cause issues.

Scenario 3: Correct output for negative sample
Details:
  TestName: test_process_negative_sample
  Description: This test verifies that the process function correctly calculates y[n] for a negative sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a negative float sample.
  Act: Call the process function with the sample as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the output is a float and the calculation is correct according to the function logic.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function works correctly with negative samples, which are less common but still valid inputs.

Scenario 4: Correct handling of sample close to zero
Details:
  TestName: test_process_small_sample
  Description: This test verifies that the process function correctly handles samples that are very close to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a sample with a value very close to zero.
  Act: Call the process function with the sample as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the output is a float and the calculation is correct according to the function logic.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function can handle samples that are very close to zero without running into precision issues.
