================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Import
Issue: The code imports several modules without controlling or verifying the sources. This could lead to potential security risks if a malicious module is imported.
Solution: Ensure all imported modules are from trusted sources. Use a virtual environment to isolate the project and its dependencies.

Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Use of External Libraries
Issue: The code uses external libraries like 'matplotlib' and 'numpy' without verifying their versions or sources. These libraries could contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
Solution: Always verify the source and version of the libraries used in the project. Regularly update the libraries to the latest versions to get security patches.

Vulnerability: Absence of Input Validation
Issue: The 'process' function accepts a float value without validating it. This can lead to potential security risks if a malicious or unexpected input is provided.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs to functions. Use Python's built-in functions or third-party libraries to ensure input is as expected.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for positive float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_positive_float
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for a positive float input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a positive float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and matches the expected output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles positive float inputs, which is a primary use case for this function.

Scenario 2: Test for zero float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for an input of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with zero as an input.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and matches the expected output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles an input of zero, which is a valid edge case for this function.

Scenario 3: Test for negative float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_negative_float
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function process correctly calculates the output for a negative float input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with a negative float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and matches the expected output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles negative float inputs, which is a valid edge case for this function.

Scenario 4: Test for extremely large float input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_float
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function process correctly handles very large float inputs without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the process function with an extremely large float number.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a float and matches the expected output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles large inputs, which is a potential edge case for this function.
