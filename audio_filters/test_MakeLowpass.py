================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The function make_lowpass does not check if the input parameters are of correct types and within the expected ranges. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Add input validation checks at the start of the function to ensure that 'frequency' and 'samplerate' are positive integers and 'q_factor' is a positive float.

Vulnerability: Exception handling (CWE-248)
Issue: The function make_lowpass does not handle potential exceptions that could be raised during its execution, such as a ZeroDivisionError if 'samplerate' is 0.
Solution: Implement try/except blocks to handle potential exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to the user.

Vulnerability: Use of third-party packages
Issue: The code imports and uses a third-party package (audio_filters.iir_filter). If this package has vulnerabilities or is compromised, it could pose a risk.
Solution: Ensure that the third-party package is trusted, maintained, and free of known vulnerabilities. Regularly update it to the latest version.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test the low-pass filter creation with default q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_lowpass_filter_creation_default_qfactor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct creation of a low-pass filter with the default q_factor. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected when the q_factor is not explicitly provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the make_lowpass function, passing a frequency and a samplerate.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the filter is correctly created with the default q_factor. The expected coefficients were calculated in advance and represent the correct values for the given inputs.

Scenario 2: Test the low-pass filter creation with a specified q_factor
Details:
  TestName: test_lowpass_filter_creation_specified_qfactor
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct creation of a low-pass filter when a specific q_factor is provided. This will ensure that the function correctly takes into account the q_factor in its calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the make_lowpass function, passing a frequency, a samplerate, and a q_factor.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the filter is correctly created with a specified q_factor. The expected coefficients were calculated in advance and represent the correct values for the given inputs.

Scenario 3: Test the low-pass filter creation with a frequency that equals the samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_lowpass_filter_creation_frequency_equals_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct creation of a low-pass filter when the frequency equals the samplerate. This is an edge case that could potentially cause issues in the calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the make_lowpass function, passing a frequency and a samplerate that are equal, and a q_factor.
  Assert: Check that the returned filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case where the frequency equals the samplerate. The expected coefficients were calculated in advance and represent the correct values for the given inputs.

Scenario 4: Test the low-pass filter creation with a frequency greater than the samplerate
Details:
  TestName: test_lowpass_filter_creation_frequency_greater_than_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function throws an exception when the frequency is greater than the samplerate. This is an invalid input condition that should result in an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the make_lowpass function, passing a frequency that is greater than the samplerate, and a q_factor.
  Assert: Check that the function throws an exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles invalid input conditions. Since the frequency cannot be greater than the samplerate, the function should throw an exception in this case.
