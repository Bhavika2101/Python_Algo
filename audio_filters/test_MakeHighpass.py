================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The function make_highpass does not check if the input parameters are of correct types and within the expected ranges. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Add input validation checks at the start of the function to ensure that 'frequency' and 'samplerate' are integers, 'q_factor' is a float, and all are within expected ranges.

Vulnerability: Uncaught exceptions (CWE-390)
Issue: The function make_highpass does not handle potential exceptions that might be thrown by its operations, such as division by zero error.
Solution: Wrap the code in a try/except block and handle potential exceptions gracefully.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Third-Party Libraries (CWE-829)
Issue: The code uses a third-party library (audio_filters.iir_filter) without checking if it's a secure, trusted library.
Solution: Ensure the third-party libraries used are trusted, well-maintained, and have been reviewed for security. Consider using a tool to check for known vulnerabilities in the dependencies.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the High-pass filter with the default q_factor.
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_default_q
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the filter coefficients when using the default q_factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency and samplerate values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the frequency and samplerate parameters.
  Assert: Check the coefficients of the returned filter.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring that the filter creation process works correctly with the default q_factor value, which is the most common use case.

Scenario 2: Testing the High-pass filter with a custom q_factor.
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_custom_q
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the filter coefficients when using a custom q_factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency, samplerate, and q_factor values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the frequency, samplerate, and q_factor parameters.
  Assert: Check the coefficients of the returned filter.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring that the filter creation process works correctly with a custom q_factor, which allows more control over the filter's characteristics.

Scenario 3: Testing the High-pass filter with a frequency equal to the samplerate.
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_frequency_equals_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the filter coefficients when the frequency is equal to the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency and samplerate values to be equal.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the frequency and samplerate parameters.
  Assert: Check the coefficients of the returned filter.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring that the filter creation process works correctly in this edge case. This scenario might reveal potential division by zero errors or other issues.

Scenario 4: Testing the High-pass filter with a frequency greater than the samplerate.
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_frequency_greater_than_samplerate
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the filter coefficients when the frequency is greater than the samplerate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency value to be greater than the samplerate value.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the frequency and samplerate parameters.
  Assert: Check the coefficients of the returned filter.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring that the filter creation process works correctly in this edge case. This scenario might reveal potential issues with the calculation of the w0 value.

Scenario 5: Testing the High-pass filter with a frequency of zero.
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_frequency_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the filter coefficients when the frequency is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the frequency value to be zero and the samplerate value to be any positive integer.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the frequency and samplerate parameters.
  Assert: Check the coefficients of the returned filter.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring that the filter creation process works correctly in this edge case. This scenario might reveal potential issues with the calculation of the w0 value.
