================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The function make_highpass does not check if the input parameters are of correct types and within the expected ranges. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Add input validation checks at the start of the function to ensure that 'frequency' and 'samplerate' are positive integers, and 'q_factor' is a positive float.

Vulnerability: Error handling (CWE-391)
Issue: The function make_highpass does not handle potential errors when setting the coefficients for the IIRFilter. If an error occurs during this process, it may cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably.
Solution: Implement try/except blocks around the set_coefficients method to catch and handle potential errors.

Vulnerability: Dependency security (CWE-937)
Issue: The code relies on an external library 'audio_filters.iir_filter'. If this library contains vulnerabilities or is compromised, it could affect the security of the entire application.
Solution: Ensure that the 'audio_filters.iir_filter' library is up-to-date and obtained from a trusted source. Regularly check for updates and security patches.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Highpass Filter Creation with valid parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_filter_creation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the high-pass filter is created correctly when provided with valid parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize frequency, samplerate, and q_factor with valid values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the created filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Validating the filter creation process is crucial because it ensures that the function works as expected with valid parameters.

Scenario 2: Test Highpass Filter Creation with frequency as zero
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_filter_creation_frequency_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highpass function when the frequency is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize frequency as zero, and samplerate and q_factor with valid values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check for any errors or exceptions, or if the created filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important because it verifies the function's behavior with a zero frequency, which is a boundary case.

Scenario 3: Test Highpass Filter Creation with q_factor as zero
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_filter_creation_q_factor_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highpass function when the q_factor is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize q_factor as zero, and frequency and samplerate with valid values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check for any errors or exceptions, or if the created filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important because it verifies the function's behavior with a zero q_factor, which is a boundary case.

Scenario 4: Test Highpass Filter Creation with negative values
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_filter_creation_negative_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highpass function when provided with negative values for frequency, samplerate, and q_factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize frequency, samplerate, and q_factor with negative values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check for any errors or exceptions.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important because it verifies the function's behavior with negative values, which can be considered as invalid inputs.

Scenario 5: Test Highpass Filter Creation with extremely large values
Details:
  TestName: test_highpass_filter_creation_large_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the make_highpass function when provided with extremely large values for frequency, samplerate, and q_factor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize frequency, samplerate, and q_factor with extremely large values.
  Act: Invoke the make_highpass function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check for any errors or exceptions, or if the created filter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs match the expected values.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important because it verifies the function's behavior with extremely large values, which can be considered as edge cases.
