================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The provided code does not validate the type of the a_coeffs and b_coeffs parameters. If a non-list object is provided, the code could encounter unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Add type checks to ensure that a_coeffs and b_coeffs are lists. Raise an appropriate error if they are not.

Vulnerability: Dependence on External Libraries
Issue: The code assumes that scipy is available and correctly installed. If the scipy library is not present, the code will fail.
Solution: Include a try/except block around the scipy import statement to catch and handle the ImportError exception. Alternatively, make sure scipy is properly installed and available in the environment where this code is running.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the coefficients of the IIR filter are set correctly by checking the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the main functionality of setting coefficients works as expected. It verifies the correct working of the function in normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Testing with a_coeffs of size less than order
Details:
  TestName: test_a_coeffs_less_than_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly handles the case when the size of a_coeffs is less than the order of the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order and valid b_coeffs of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the method correctly modifies a_coeffs by checking the a_coeffs attribute of the IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the method correctly handles the case when a_coeffs is missing the a_0 coefficient. It verifies the correct working of the function in this edge case.

Scenario 3: Testing with a_coeffs of size not equal to order+1
Details:
  TestName: test_a_coeffs_size_not_equal_to_order_plus_one
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly raises a ValueError when the size of a_coeffs is not equal to order+1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size not equal to order+1 and valid b_coeffs of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the method raises a ValueError with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the method correctly raises an error when the size of a_coeffs is not as expected. It verifies the correct error handling of the function.

Scenario 4: Testing with b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1
Details:
  TestName: test_b_coeffs_size_not_equal_to_order_plus_one
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly raises a ValueError when the size of b_coeffs is not equal to order+1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid a_coeffs of size order+1 and b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the method raises a ValueError with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the method correctly raises an error when the size of b_coeffs is not as expected. It verifies the correct error handling of the function.
