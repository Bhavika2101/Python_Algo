================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unspecific Exceptions
Issue: Current exception handling in the code raises only ValueError, it would be beneficial to have more specific exceptions depending on the error message.
Solution: Implement more specific exceptions to clarify the nature of the error. This would make debugging easier and less error-prone.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs list with size equal to order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_valid_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly assigns the input lists a_coeffs and b_coeffs to the class attributes self.a_coeffs and self.b_coeffs when they are of size order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class with a given order and then create two lists a_coeffs and b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients function on the IIRFilter instance, passing the a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: The instance's a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes should now equal the input values.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function correctly implements the basic feature of setting the coefficients. The expected result is that the set coefficients should match the input coefficients.

Scenario 2: a_coeffs size less than the given order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_size_less_than_order
  Description: The test is intended to verify if the function correctly adds 1.0 as the first element in the a_coeffs list when the size of a_coeffs is less than the order of the filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class with a given order and then create a list a_coeffs of size less than order and b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients function on the IIRFilter instance, passing the a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: The function should not raise an error, and the first element of the instance's a_coeffs should be 1.0.
Validation:
  This test verifies the business logic of using 1.0 as the default value of a_theta[0] which is integral to the workings of the IIRFilter.

Scenario 3: Invalid a_coeffs list with size not equal to order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function raises a ValueError when the size of the a_coeffs list is not equal to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class with a given order and then create a list a_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1, and a b_coeffs list of correct size.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients function on the IIRFilter instance, passing the a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: The function should raise a ValueError indicating incorrect input.
Validation:
  This test is necessary to ensure the function's correct behavior by validating the input, in keeping with the business logic.

Scenario 4: Invalid b_coeffs list with size not equal to order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function raises a ValueError when the size of the b_coeffs list is not equal to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class with a given order and then create a list b_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1, and an a_coeffs list of correct size.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients function on the IIRFilter instance, passing the a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: The function should raise a ValueError indicating incorrect input.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify the function's error handling when b_coeffs is not of the correct size, adhering to the business logic.
