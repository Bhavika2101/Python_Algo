================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Dependency on an insecure third-party package
Issue: The version of the scipy library that this code depends on could contain vulnerabilities if it's not up-to-date.
Solution: Ensure that the scipy library and all other dependencies are kept up-to-date with secure, stable versions. Regularly check for and apply security patches to mitigate any known vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the correct functioning of set_coefficients method with valid input.

Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_valid_input
  Description: This test will validate if the method set_coefficients sets the coefficients correctly when provided with valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize IIRFilter object with a certain order say 2. Prepare valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists of size order+1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method passing the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs values. 
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the filter object match the input lists.

Validation:
  Rationalising this test, as its success ensures that the basic functionality of the set_coefficients method is working. Keeping an order matches with the passed coefficients is a business requirement, which this test case ensures.

Scenario 2: Validate set_coefficients when a_coeffs list is smaller than order.

Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_when_a_coeffs_smaller_than_order
  Description: This test will validate if the method set_coefficients can handle a smaller a_coeffs list, and automatically set the first term as 1.0.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize IIRFilter object with a certain order say 2. Prepare valid a_coeffs (less than order+1) and b_coeffs lists of size order+1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method passing the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs values.
  Assert: Check if the first term of a_coeffs attribute of filter object is 1.0. Also, the sizes of a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes should be equal to order+1.

Validation:
  The rationale behind this scenario is to verify the ability of the program to handle a specific business logic requirement: setting the default value of the first term to 1.0, if it is not provided in the a_coeffs list. 

Scenario 3: Validate set_coefficients when a_coeffs or b_coeffs list has incorrect size.

Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_when_coefficients_have_incorrect_size
  Description: This test will validate if the method set_coefficients can handle the scenario when the lengths of a_coeffs or b_coeffs lists are not order+1, and raise ValueError.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists with size not equal to order+1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method passing the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs and catch the ValueError.
  Assert: Check if ValueError is raised with the correct error message: "Expected a_coeffs/b_coeffs to have {order + 1} elements for {order}-order filter, got {len(a_coeffs/b_coeffs)}".

Validation:
  This test scenario ensures that the method is able to correctly handle error scenarios, and prevents the program from working with invalid data which could otherwise result in unintended consequences. This is crucial from a business perspective, as it ensures data integrity and reliability.
