================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The code does not validate type of input provided to the set_coefficients method. This can lead to errors if input of incorrect type is passed, impacting the application's stability.
Solution: Implement type checking for the input parameters. For example, verify if a_coeffs and b_coeffs are indeed list of floats before proceeding with the method.

Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution (CWE-94)
Issue: The third-party library scipy is used in the submitted code without ensuring its source and integrity. If scipy was modified maliciously before being imported, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.
Solution: Ensure that third-party libraries like scipy are sourced from a trusted source, ideally directly from the official package registries (like PyPI). Consider using a tool for verifying the integrity of third-party code.

Vulnerability: Error Handling (CWE-389)
Issue: The code does not handle exception scenarios beyond incorrect size of coefficients. Errors related to unavailable modules or incorrectly formed coefficients are not caught, which can lead to application crashes.
Solution: Extend the error/exception handling to cover all scenarios where issues can occur. This includes import errors for third-party libraries and type/content errors for coefficient lists.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful setting of coefficients for IIR filter
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_coefficients_setting
  Description: This test is to verify the successful setting of coefficients for an IIR filter when a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists are of size order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with an order parameter. Define two lists, a_coeffs and b_coeffs each with elements equal to the order parameter + 1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients function of the IIRFilter object, passing in a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: The expected outcome is that the function terminates successfully without any error and the IIRFilter object's a_coeffs and b_coeffs correspond to the initially defined lists.
Validation:
  The successful setting of coefficients is the normal, expected behavior of the method, confirming the method's basic functionality.

Scenario 2: Automatic adjustment of the a_coeffs list by adding default value 1.0
Details:
  TestName: test_automatic_a_coeffs_adjustment
  Description: This test is to verify that when a_coeffs is of size less than order, a default value of 1.0 is automatically added to the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with an order parameter. Define a_coeffs list with elements less than the order parameter and b_coeffs list has elements equal to order parameter + 1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients function of the IIRFilter object, passing in a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: The a_coeffs list of the IIRFilter object should now have a length equal to order parameter + 1 with a default 1.0 value added.
Validation:
  This scenario confirms the method's functionality of automatically adjusting a_coeffs length.

Scenario 3: Invalid length of a_coeffs resulting in ValueError
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_length_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is to verify that a ValueError is raised when the length of a_coeffs is not equal to the order parameter + 1 after adjustment.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with an order parameter. Define a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists each having elements not equal to the order parameter + 1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with a_coeffs and b_coeffs passed as arguments.
  Assert: The test should catch a ValueError indicating the wrong size of the a_coeffs list.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies the method's error handling when a_coeffs does not have the correct number of coefficients.

Scenario 4: Invalid length of b_coeffs resulting in ValueError
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_length_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is to verify that a ValueError is raised when the length of b_coeffs is not equal to order parameter + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with an order parameter. Define a_coeffs list of size order parameter + 1 and b_coeffs list of size not equal to order parameter + 1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients function of the IIRFilter object, passing in a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: The test should catch a ValueError indicating the wrong size of the b_coeffs list.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies the method's error handling when b_coeffs does not have the correct number of coefficients.
