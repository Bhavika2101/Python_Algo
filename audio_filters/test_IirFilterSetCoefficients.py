================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Predictable PRNG (CWE-338)
Issue: There's no use of random number generation in the code provided, but be aware that reliance on Python's built-in PRNG can yield predictable results, which may be exploited by a malicious actor to infer sensitive information.
Solution: If the underlying application requires secure random number generation such as for encryption keys or tokens, it is recommended to use 'secrets' or 'os.urandom' module, which are designed for generating cryptographically strong random numbers.

Vulnerability: Improper Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: Input parameters 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' of function 'set_coefficients' are not validated for data types. This could result in unexpected behavior or errors if non-list/non-float entries are provided.
Solution: For type checking and to ensure safety, use 'isinstance' method to check the data type of parameters, and raise appropriate exceptions if the type is not as expected.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Third-party Library (CWE-829)
Issue: The code uses 'scipy.signal' modules. The version is not specified, and an outdated or insecure version may be in use.
Solution: Always specify the exact trusted version of third-party libraries to use to ensure the application is shielded from vulnerabilities present in outdated or insecure versions. Example: scipy==1.5.2 instead of just scipy.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate correct coefficients assignment with correct lengths
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_correct_lengths
  Description: The test verifies that when the a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists have the correct lengths, they are correctly assigned to the IIRFilter object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with an order of 2. Define a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists, each containing 3 numbers.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method on the IIRFilter object, passing in a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Verify that the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attribute of the IIRFilter object matches the defined a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists.
Validation:
  The correct assignment of coefficients is fundamental to ensuring the IIRFilter behaves as expected during use. Ensuring this behavior in valid input scenarios verifies that the function meets the basic specifications.

Scenario 2: Validate default a_0 value assignment when a_coeffs length < order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_default_a0_value
  Description: The test verifies that when the a_coeffs list is shorter than the order, 1.0 is added to the start of the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with an order of 2. Define an a_coeffs list of two numbers and a b_coeffs list with three numbers.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method on the IIRFilter object, passing in a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Verify that the first element of the a_coeffs attribute of the IIRFilter object is 1.0.
Validation:
  Ensuring this behavior checks that the function accounts for cases where a_0 may not be provided, while still adhering to the constraint of having the list size equal to order + 1.

Scenario 3: Validate that a ValueError is raised when a_coeffs length != order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_incorrect_length_a_coeffs
  Description: The test verifies that when the length of a_coeffs is not equal to order + 1, a ValueError is raised.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with an order of 2. Define an a_coeffs list with four numbers and a b_coeffs list with three numbers.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method on the IIRFilter object, passing in a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Verify that a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  Ensuring this behavior checks that the function correctly handles incorrect inputs to maintain consistency.

Scenario 4: Validate that a ValueError is raised when b_coeffs length != order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_incorrect_length_b_coeffs
  Description: The test verifies that when the length of b_coeffs is not equal to order + 1, a ValueError is raised.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with an order of 2. Define an a_coeffs list with three numbers and a b_coeffs list with two numbers.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method on the IIRFilter object, passing in a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Verify that a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  The ValueError serves as a defense mechanism against incorrect inputs which can potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors down the line, validating the method's error handling.
