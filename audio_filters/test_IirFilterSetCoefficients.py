================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The function set_coefficients does not validate if the input parameters a_coeffs and b_coeffs are actually lists. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the function is called with inappropriate parameters.
Solution: Add type checking for a_coeffs and b_coeffs at the start of the function. If they are not of the type list, raise an appropriate error.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of External Library (CWE-1173)
Issue: The code imports scipy.signal but does not handle potential import errors. If scipy is not installed or not available for some reason, the script will fail with an ImportError.
Solution: Surround the import statement with a try/except block to handle the ImportError and provide an informative error message.

Vulnerability: Insecure Defaults (CWE-758)
Issue: The function set_coefficients uses an insecure default value of 1.0 for a_coeffs. This could lead to incorrect results if the function is called with a_coeffs missing.
Solution: Ensure that all necessary parameters are passed to the function. If a_coeffs is missing, raise an appropriate error instead of using a default value.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the coefficients have been set correctly by comparing them with the input coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of setting coefficients is working as expected. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly setting the coefficients.

Scenario 2: Test the setting of coefficients when a_coeffs list has less than order elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the automatic addition of 1.0 to the a_coeffs list when its size is less than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order and valid b_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs have been set correctly by comparing them with the input coefficients, considering the automatic addition of 1.0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly handling the situation when a_coeffs list has less than order elements. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly adding 1.0 to the a_coeffs list when required.

Scenario 3: Test the setting of coefficients when a_coeffs list has more than order + 1 elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_more_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's error handling when the a_coeffs list size is more than order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size more than order + 1 and valid b_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError with a specific error message.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly handling the situation when a_coeffs list has more than order + 1 elements. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly raising an error in this situation.

Scenario 4: Test the setting of coefficients when b_coeffs list size is not equal to order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's error handling when the b_coeffs list size is not equal to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, prepare valid a_coeffs, and b_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError with a specific error message.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly handling the situation when b_coeffs list size is not equal to order + 1. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly raising an error in this situation.
