================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: Even though the types of a_coeffs and b_coeffs are mentioned in the function definition, Python does not enforce type checking. So, there is a risk of a TypeError being raised when functions for list or float types are invoked on these parameters.
Solution: You should explicitly check the type of parameters and make sure they are list of floats. If they aren't, you should handle this situation in a way appropriate for your application. One possible way of handling is raising TypeError with a meaningful message.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Normal function operation with correctly sized a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_normal_operation
  Description: This test should validate the function's ability to successfully set both a_coeffs and b_coeffs if the input is valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a IIRFilter object with a set filter size. Generate two appropriately sized lists of floats for a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Act: Call the function set_coefficients on the IIRFilter object using the generated a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists as input.
  Assert: Check if a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the IIRFilter object have been correctly set to the input lists.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function performs its primary task successfully under expected operation.

Scenario 2: a_coeffs list is too short and needs to use default value.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_a_coeffs_too_short
  Description: This test validates the function's behavior when the a_coeffs list is short.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a IIRFilter object with a set filter size and a a_coeffs list shorter by 1 from the filter order.
  Act: Call the function set_coefficients on the IIRFilter object using the generated a_coeffs and a correctly sized b_coeffs list.
  Assert: Check if a_coeffs of the IIRFilter object has been correctly set, with the first value as 1.0.
Validation:
  It is important to test this to ensure that the function correctly defaults to 1.0 if a_coeff[0] is not provided.

Scenario 3: a_coeffs list is not the correct size and generates a ValueError.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_a_coeffs_wrong_size
  Description: This test should check if the function raises a ValueError when given an a_coeffs list that is not related to the order of the IIRFilter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a IIRFilter object with a set order and an a_coeffs list that matches neither order nor order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the function set_coefficients on the IIRFilter object with the a_coeffs and a properly sized b_coeffs list.
  Assert: Confirm that the function raises a ValueError.
Validation:
  Validation on input size is a vital part of business logic and this test ensures the function behaves appropriately when receiving invalid input.

Scenario 4: b_coeffs list is not the correct size and generates a ValueError.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_b_coeffs_wrong_size
  Description: This test confirms the function raises a ValueError when given a b_coeffs list that is not order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a IIRFilter object with a set order and a b_coeffs list that is not order + 1.
  Act: Call the function set_coefficients on the IIRFilter object using correctly sized a_coeffs and the incorrectly sized b_coeffs list.
  Assert: Confirm that a ValueError is raised by the function.
Validation:
  Checking b_coeffs list size is crucial to the function's operation. This test confirms that the function appropriately handles invalid input.
