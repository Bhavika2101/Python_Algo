================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The coefficients are not validated. Malicious input may cause unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Validate the input before processing it i.e., check that they are indeed numbers and within acceptable range.

Vulnerability: Denial of Service (CWE-730)
Issue: Passing a large list to a_coeffs or b_coeffs could consume significant memory and CPU resources
Solution: Limit the size of the accepted lists and handle excessively large inputs correctly.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test set_coefficients with correct input
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_correct_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that set_coefficients works correctly when it receives correct input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter instance with an order. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs of size order+1.
  Act: Call set_coefficients method by passing a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check whether no exception is thrown and self.a_coeffs and self.b_coeffs have the values of a_coeffs and b_coeffs respectively.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function works as expected when it receives the correct values.

Scenario 2: Test set_coefficients when a_coeffs is missing one item
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_lesser_length_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that set_coefficients works correctly when a_coeffs is missing one item.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter instance with an order. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs such that a_coeffs is missing one item.
  Act: Call set_coefficients method by passing a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check whether no exception is thrown and a_coeffs has been appended with 1.0 at the beginning.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function resolves an a_coeffs list that is missing 1 item by itself.

Scenario 3: Test set_coefficients with incorrect length of a_coeffs
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_incorrect_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that set_coefficients throws ValueError when a_coeffs has more or less items than the order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter instance with an order. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs such that a_coeffs has an incorrect length.
  Act: Call set_coefficients method by passing a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check whether ValueError exception is thrown.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function throws an error when a_coeffs has inappropriate length.

Scenario 4: Test set_coefficients with incorrect length of b_coeffs
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_incorrect_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that set_coefficients throws ValueError when b_coeffs has more or less items than the order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter instance with an order. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs such that b_coeffs has an incorrect length.
  Act: Call set_coefficients method by passing a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check whether ValueError exception is thrown.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function throws an error when b_coeffs has inappropriate length.
