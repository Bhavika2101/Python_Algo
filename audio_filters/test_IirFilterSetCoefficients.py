================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation CWE-20
Issue: The function set_coefficients accepts list inputs but does not validate the type of elements within these lists. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the elements are not of type float.
Solution: Add type checking for elements within the a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists to ensure they are all floats.

Vulnerability: Potential Denial of Service CWE-730
Issue: The function set_coefficients does not limit the size of the input lists. Large inputs could consume considerable memory and CPU resources when processed, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
Solution: Implement size limitations for the input lists and reject inputs that exceed these limits.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the coefficients of the IIR filter are set correctly by checking the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the main functionality of setting coefficients works as expected. It verifies the correct working of the function in normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Testing with a_coeffs of size less than order
Details:
  TestName: test_a_coeffs_less_than_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly handles the case when the size of a_coeffs is less than the order of the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order and valid b_coeffs of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the a_coeffs attribute of the IIRFilter object is of size order+1 and starts with 1.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the case when a_coeffs is of size less than order, as it should set a_0 to 1.0 by default.

Scenario 3: Testing with a_coeffs or b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1
Details:
  TestName: test_coeffs_not_equal_to_order_plus_one
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly raises a ValueError when the size of a_coeffs or b_coeffs is not equal to order+1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs or b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that a ValueError is raised with the appropriate error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly raises an error when the input coefficients are of invalid size, as per the method's specifications.
