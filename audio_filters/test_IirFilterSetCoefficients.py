================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Third Party Libraries
Issue: The code imports the scipy library but does not check its version or integrity. If a compromised version is used, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Introduce checks to ensure that the correct and secure version of the scipy library is in use. Use pip hash-checking mode to ensure package integrity during installation.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Sanitization
Issue: The function accepts user inputs (a_coeffs and b_coeffs) and doesn't sanitize or validate them. If unexpected inputs are fed in, the function could behave unpredictably.
Solution: Add checks to validate both the type and values of elements in a_coeffs and b_coeffs. It is a good practice to verify that the received input matches the expected format.

Vulnerability: Inconsistent Error Messaging
Issue: In the error message of the second ValueError, it's showing the length of a_coeffs, not b_coeffs. This could confuse debugging process.
Solution: Replace len(a_coeffs) with len(b_coeffs) in the second error message to accurately report the issue.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test successful coefficients setting for IIR filter
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_success
  Description: The test is intended to verify if the coefficients for the IIR filter are set correctly when the list size of a_coeffs and b_coeffs are equal to the order of the filter+1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a IIRFilter object with a specified order. Create two lists of coefficients a_coeffs and b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the created a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the object are set to the passed lists.
Validation:
  This test validates the successful operation of the function given the precisely correct and expected inputs. It confirms that the function correctly assigns the values under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Test a_coeffs setting with size less than the filter order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_default_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the coefficients 'a_coeffs' are set correctly when the size of a_coeffs is less than the order. The function should prepend 1.0 to the a_coeffs list to make its size equal to the order+1
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a IIRFilter object with a specified order. Create a_coeffs of size less than order and b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the created a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check if the size of a_coeffs of the object is order + 1 and that 1.0 was prepended to the list.
Validation:
  This test validates the automatic correction of a_coeffs size by pre-pending 1.0 to the list when it is less than the filter order.

Scenario 3: Test coefficient setting with a_coeffs size not equal to filter order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_invalid_a_coeffs_size
  Description: The test is intended to verify the ValueError thrown when the a_coeffs size is not equal to the order of the filter+1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a IIRFilter object with a specified order. Create a_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1 and b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the created a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Assert that a ValueError is raised with the appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly reject inappropriate input, and throw appropriate error. It provides assurance that the function can cope with atypical usage patterns. 

Scenario 4: Test coefficient setting with b_coeffs size not equal to filter order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_invalid_b_coeffs_size
  Description: The test is intended to verify the ValueError thrown when the b_coeffs size is not equal to the order of the filter+1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a IIRFilter object with a specified order. Create a_coeffs of size equal to order + 1 and b_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the created a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Assert that a ValueError is raised with the appropriate error message.
Validation:
  Similar to Scenario 3, this test validates the function's ability to correctly reject inappropriate input and throw suitable error which is important for maintaining the integrity of the IIR filter coefficients.
