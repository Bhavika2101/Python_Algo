================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Python's Standard Library Functionality (Unvalidated inputs)
Issue: The functions accept user-provided input without any form of validation, which can lead to errors or exceptions.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that only expected and safe inputs are processed. Use Python's typing module to enforce type annotations.

Vulnerability: Mishandling of Exceptions
Issue: Error messages expose internal information (such as specifics of array length), potentially leaking sensitive system details.
Solution: Modify error messages to be more generic and do not expose implementation details. Consider using custom exception classes to handle specific error cases.

Vulnerability: Variables Leakage (via Global Namespace)
Issue: Usage of 'self' modifies variables on the instance, which can lead to cross-talk or leaking of information if improperly handled.
Solution: Apply principles of encapsulation to ensure data is compartmentalized. Use name mangling for private variables (double underscore prefix e.g., self.__a_coeffs).

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate successful coefficient assignment when valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs are provided.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_successful
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function successfully sets a_coeffs and b_coeffs when valid lists of coefficients are provided, observing the size condition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object with a certain order, and create two valid lists of coefficients.
  Act: Invoke set_coefficients with the created lists as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the coefficients have been assigned correctly in the filter object.
Validation:
  It's essential to test that the function can handle valid input correctly, as this forms the basis of the function's expected behavior.

Scenario 2: Validate successful coefficient assignment when a_coeffs is smaller than order.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_extend_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that if the length of a_coeffs is smaller than the filter's order, the function successfully extends a_coeffs by inserting 1.0 at the start.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object with a certain order, and create a_coeffs that's smaller than the order, and a valid b_coeffs list.
  Act: Invoke set_coefficients with the created lists as parameters.
  Assert: Check that a_coeffs has been extended correctly, and that both a_coeffs and b_coeffs have been assigned correctly in the filter object.
Validation:
  The function is designed to handle a_coeffs of smaller size than required by implicitly inserting 1.0 at its start. This test verifies this behavior, which is crucial for user-friendliness and flexibility of the function.

Scenario 3: Validate correct failure when a_coeffs is not of expected size.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_a_coeffs_wrong_size
  Description: This test is to confirm that the function raises a ValueError when a_coeffs is neither equal to order nor (order + 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object with a certain order, and create an a_coeffs list that is neither equal to order nor (order + 1), and a valid b_coeffs list.
  Act: Invoke set_coefficients with the created lists as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is needed to catch incorrect input scenarios where a_coeffs size does not match the precondition defined in the function's documentation.

Scenario 4: Validate correct failure when b_coeffs is not of expected size.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_b_coeffs_wrong_size
  Description: This test is to confirm that the function raises a ValueError when b_coeffs is not of size (order + 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object with a certain order, and create a valid a_coeffs list but an invalid b_coeffs list (not of size order + 1).
  Act: Invoke set_coefficients with the created lists as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is needed to catch incorrect input scenarios where the size of b_coeffs does not meet the precondition outlined in the function's documentation. 

Scenario 5: Validate case when a_coeffs or b_coeffs are empty.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_empty_lists
  Description: This test is to confirm that the function can handle empty a_coeffs or b_coeffs input, extending a_coeffs but throwing a ValueError for b_coeffs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a filter object with order = 0, and create empty a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists.
  Act: Invoke set_coefficients with the created lists as parameters.
  Assert: Validate that ValueError is raised for empty b_coeffs but that a_coeffs is successfully extended with 1.0.
Validation:
  This test confirms the functionâ€™s ability to respond appropriately to edge-case inputs, reflecting its robustness. It returns correct and relevant responses to each case: extending a_coeffs and raising an error for invalid b_coeffs.
