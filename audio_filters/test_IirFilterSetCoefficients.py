Scenario 1: Test for correct coefficients setting in IIR Filter
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_correct_coeffs
  Description: The test verifies that coefficients for the IIR filter are correctly set when appropriate coefficients are provided. The number of coefficients for a and b should be the same and specified filter order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a filter object with a valid order and prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs list of floats with required size (order + 1).
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method, passing the prepared a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check if the values of a_coeffs and b_coeffs in the filter object are the same as passed to the function.
Validation:
  Having the correct coefficients set is crucial for accurate filter operation. Ensuring this, aligns with function's defined roles and business specifications necessary for outputting precise results in subsequent operations.

Scenario 2: Test that set_coefficients substitutes 1.0 as default for a_0 when a_coeffs is missing a_0
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_missing_a0
  Description: The test verifies that 1.0 is substituted as the default value for a_0 when it is missing in a_coeffs. This falls in line with function's behavior of assigning 1.0 to a_0 when not provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the filter. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists. Ensure a_coeffs does not contain a_0 (the first value).
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with these lists.
  Assert: Check if a_coeffs at index 0 equals 1.0 in the filter object.
Validation:
  This validates function's accommodation for a missing a_0 by setting it to default behaviour (1.0), aligning with expected behaviour and business requirements. Ensuring this feature affirms results of subsequent operation stays accurate. 

Scenario 3: Test that set_coefficients raises ValueError given a_coeffs with size less than filter order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficientsRaisesValueError_for_a_coeffs_smallSize
  Description: This tests that a ValueError is raised when the size of a_coeffs is less than the defined filter order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the filter. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists where the length of a_coeffs is less than the order.
  Act: Call set_coefficients with these lists.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError with the correct error message is raised.
Validation:
  Giving feedback when the number of a_coeffs fails the size requirement is a crucial part of maintaining accurate filter settings. This test asserts that the function correctly handles such cases and abides by the business logic of the system.

Scenario 4: Test that set_coefficients raises ValueError given b_coeffs with size less than filter order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficientsRaisesValueError_for_b_coeffs_smallSize
  Description: This tests that a ValueError is raised when the size of b_coeffs is less than the defined filter order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the filter. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs list with a length of b_coeffs less than the order.
  Act: Call set_coefficients with these lists.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError with the correct error message is raised.
Validation:
  Ensuring accurate feedback when the number of b_coeffs fails the size requirement maintains the integrity of filter settings. This test validates that the function handles such conditions and aligns with the business logic of the application.
