================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input validation
Issue: The function signature expects inputs to be a list of float but there is no type validation within the function to enforce this. It accepts any data type that can use the `len` and square bracket indexing features like string. This could lead to unexpected behaviour or crashes.
Solution: Introduce explicit checks for the input types at the beginning of the function and raise TypeError if it's not a list of floats.

Vulnerability: Error messages
Issue: The error message for the ValueError raised when length of `b_coeffs` is not equal to `order` + 1 mistakenly uses `len(a_coeffs)` instead of `len(b_coeffs)`. This could be misleading when debugging or handling errors as it gives incorrect information about the source of the problem.
Solution: Change `len(a_coeffs)` to `len(b_coeffs)` in the error message when `len(b_coeffs) != self.order + 1`.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_success_setting_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the coefficients can be set successfully when the coefficients' length matches the filter order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize IIRFilter instance with a specific order and coefficients that match the order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the aforementioned coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the coefficients in the IIRFilter instance correctly matches the input coefficients.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the test's importance, we must ensure the normal functioning of the filter, which depends significantly on accurately setting coefficients which align with the filter order.

Scenario 2: Testing for successful correction of 'a_coeffs' by adding default value when size is less than order
Details:
  TestName: test_a_coeffs_correction
  Description: This test is to verify if the function correctly adjusts the 'a_coeffs' when the length is less than the filter order by prepending a default 1.0 value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter instance with a specific order and 'a_coeffs' that does not include a default value.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the incomplete 'a_coeffs'.
  Assert: Check if the first element in 'a_coeffs' in the IIRFilter instance is the default 1.0.
Validation:
  This test helps to verify the function's ability to handle incomplete 'a_coeffs' data which enhances the function's reliability.

Scenario 3: Testing for raising ValueError when 'a_coeffs' size does not match order
Details:
  TestName: test_raising_exception_when_a_coeffs_does_not_match_order
  Description: This test verifies if a ValueError is raised when the size of 'a_coeffs' is not equal to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter instance with a specific order and 'a_coeffs' of size not equal to order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the incompatible 'a_coeffs'.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  The test is important as it validates that a user cannot set incorrect 'a_coeffs', thus ensuring the consistency of the IIRFilter configuration.

Scenario 4: Testing for raising ValueError when 'b_coeffs' size does not match order
Details:
  TestName: test_raising_exception_when_b_coeffs_does_not_match_order
  Description: This test verifies if a ValueError is raised when the size of 'b_coeffs' is not equal to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter instance with a specific order and 'b_coeffs' of size not equal to order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the incompatible 'b_coeffs'.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  The test is crucial in validating the function's requirement for 'b_coeffs' to be of a certain size, which affects the IIRFilter's accurate configuration.
