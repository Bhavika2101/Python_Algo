================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The provided code does not validate the type of the a_coeffs and b_coeffs parameters. If a non-list object is provided, the code could encounter unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Add type checks to ensure that a_coeffs and b_coeffs are lists. Raise an appropriate error if they are not.

Vulnerability: Dependence on External Libraries
Issue: The code assumes that scipy.signal is available and correctly installed. If it isn't, the code could fail to run.
Solution: Include error handling for the import statement to catch any ImportError exceptions and provide a useful error message. Alternatively, make sure scipy is properly installed as a project dependency.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the coefficients have been set correctly by comparing them with the input coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of setting coefficients is working as expected. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly setting the coefficients.

Scenario 2: Test the setting of coefficients when a_coeffs list has less than order elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the automatic addition of 1.0 to the a_coeffs list when its size is less than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order and valid b_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs have been set correctly by comparing them with the input coefficients, considering the automatic addition of 1.0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly handling the situation when a_coeffs list has less than order elements. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly adding 1.0 to the a_coeffs list when required.

Scenario 3: Test the setting of coefficients when a_coeffs list has more than order elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_more_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the ValueError thrown when a_coeffs list has more than order elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size more than order and valid b_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError to be raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly handling the situation when a_coeffs list has more than order elements. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly throwing an error when required.

Scenario 4: Test the setting of coefficients when b_coeffs list has more than order elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_more_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the ValueError thrown when b_coeffs list has more than order elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare b_coeffs of size more than order and valid a_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError to be raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly handling the situation when b_coeffs list has more than order elements. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly throwing an error when required.
