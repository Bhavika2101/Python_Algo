================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Dependency
Issue: The code is using scipy library. If it's not updated regularly, it could potentially open up risks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies which could be exploited.
Solution: Regularly update scipy and all other dependencies to the latest stable versions. Consider using a tool like PyUp or Snyk to track and update your dependencies.

Vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Issue: The code could be at risk of a DoS attack. The list arguments 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' are not validated for length or size, meaning an attacker could potentially pass a very large list and use up all server resources.
Solution: Implement checks to ensure the input lists are within acceptable length ranges before proceeding with processing.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid coefficients of correct size are set successfully.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_success
  Description: The test is intended to confirm that the function publishes correct coefficients with the correct number of elements, equal to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a_coeffs and b_coeffs as two floating-point list elements, and the order of the IIRFilter object is equal to the length of these list minus 1.
  Act: Invoke set_coefficients on the IIRFilter instance, with a_coeffs and b_coeffs as the arguments.
  Assert: Confirm that the a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the invoked IIRFilter instance matches the provided coefficients.
Validation:
  The test validates that the function correctly sets coefficients when they are valid. This conforms to the function's specifications as it is meant to set the coefficients for an IIR filter.

Scenario 2: ValueError raised when coefficients are shorter than the order of the filter.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_too_short
  Description: This test verifies that the function raises a ValueError when provided coefficients with less elements than the order of the filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a_coeffs and b_coeffs to have length less than the filter order.
  Act: Attempt to execute set_coefficients on the IIRFilter instance with a_coeffs and b_coeffs as the arguments.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  The test shows the function's compliance to its business rule exceptions, specifically when coefficients are too short. This is within the function's specifications that the len(coefficient) = order + 1.

Scenario 3: Missing 'a_0' coefficient is set to 1.0 by default.
Details:
  TestName: test_default_lead_coefficient
  Description: This test validates the function's ability to set a missing 'a_0' coefficient to 1.0 by default.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a_coeffs and b_coeffs with length = order. Set a_0 coefficient (first element) to be missing in a_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke set_coefficients on the IIRFilter instance with a_coeffs and b_coeffs as the arguments.
  Assert: Confirm that the first element of the a_coeffs for the IIRFilter instance is 1.0
Validation:
  This test allows to verify the functionality of the business logic wherein an initiation of the 'a_0' coefficient is managed internally with a default value. This ensures that the function gives correct results even when a_0 is not provided.

Scenario 4: ValueError raised when excess coefficients are provided.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_excess
  Description: This test checks that the function raises a ValueError when provided with lists of coefficients that are too long (more than order + 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a_coeffs and b_coeffs to have more than order + 1 elements.
  Act: Attempt to execute set_coefficients on the filt object with a_coeffs and b_coeffs as the arguments.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle exceptions accurately, specifically when more coefficients than needed are provided. The function's specifications explicitly set the length of the coefficients.
