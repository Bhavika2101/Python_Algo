================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation CWE-20
Issue: The function set_coefficients accepts list inputs but does not validate the type of elements within these lists. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the elements are not of type float.
Solution: Add type checking for elements within the a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists to ensure they are all floats.

Vulnerability: Potential Denial of Service CWE-730
Issue: The function set_coefficients does not limit the size of the input lists. Large inputs could consume considerable system resources, potentially leading to a denial of service.
Solution: Implement a limit for the size of the input lists, and reject inputs that exceed this limit.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the coefficients of the IIR filter are set correctly by checking the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks the basic functionality of the set_coefficients method, which is crucial for the correct operation of the IIR filter.

Scenario 2: Testing with a_coeffs of size less than order
Details:
  TestName: test_a_coeffs_less_than_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly handles the case when the size of a_coeffs is less than the order of the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order and valid b_coeffs of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the method correctly inserts 1.0 as the first element of a_coeffs and sets the coefficients of the IIR filter correctly.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks that the method correctly handles the special case when a_coeffs is of size less than order, as specified in the method's documentation.

Scenario 3: Testing with a_coeffs or b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1
Details:
  TestName: test_coefficients_not_equal_to_order_plus_one
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly raises a ValueError when the size of a_coeffs or b_coeffs is not equal to order+1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare coefficients of size not equal to order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the method raises a ValueError with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks that the method correctly raises an error when the coefficients are of invalid size, ensuring that the IIR filter is not set with incorrect coefficients.
