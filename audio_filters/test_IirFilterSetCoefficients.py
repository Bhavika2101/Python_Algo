================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation CWE-20
Issue: The function set_coefficients accepts list inputs but does not validate the type of elements within these lists. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the elements are not of type float.
Solution: Add a validation check to ensure all elements in the a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists are of type float. Raise a TypeError with a descriptive error message if the check fails.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling CWE-703
Issue: The function raises ValueError when the lengths of a_coeffs and b_coeffs are not equal to the order + 1. However, in the error message for b_coeffs, it incorrectly refers to the length of a_coeffs.
Solution: Correct the error message for b_coeffs to refer to the length of b_coeffs. This will provide accurate feedback to the user about the error.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the coefficients of the IIR filter are set correctly by checking the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks the basic functionality of the set_coefficients method, which is crucial for the correct operation of the IIR filter.

Scenario 2: Testing the automatic addition of a default value when a_coeffs is too short
Details:
  TestName: test_auto_addition_of_default_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify that when the list a_coeffs is too short, a default value of 1.0 is automatically added.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare coefficients of size order.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the first element of a_coeffs is 1.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks if the set_coefficients method correctly handles the situation when a_coeffs is too short, which is a feature of this method as per the docstring.

Scenario 3: Testing the error when a_coeffs is of incorrect size
Details:
  TestName: test_error_when_a_coeffs_incorrect_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify that an error is raised when a_coeffs is of incorrect size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare coefficients of size other than order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that a ValueError is raised with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks if the set_coefficients method correctly raises an error when a_coeffs is of incorrect size, which is a necessary error handling mechanism.

Scenario 4: Testing the error when b_coeffs is of incorrect size
Details:
  TestName: test_error_when_b_coeffs_incorrect_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify that an error is raised when b_coeffs is of incorrect size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare coefficients of size other than order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that a ValueError is raised with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks if the set_coefficients method correctly raises an error when b_coeffs is of incorrect size, which is a necessary error handling mechanism.
