================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Incorrect exception information
Issue: The error message raised for incorrect length of b_coeffs is reporting the length of a_coeffs.
Solution: Replace the instance of a_coeffs with b_coeffs in the respective ValueError message.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verifying Correct Coefficients Assignment
Details:
  TestName: test_assigning_correct_number_of_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method sets the coefficients correctly when the number of coefficients in both 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' equals the order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter object with an order. Prepare 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' with a size that equals the order + 1.
  Act: Call the 'set_coefficients' method of IIRFilter with the prepared 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs'.
  Assert: Check that the coefficients are assigned correctly within the IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  It is important to confirm that the 'set_coefficients' function works as expected under normal conditions. Ensuring the correct assignment of coefficients is paramount to the filter's functionality.

Scenario 2: Verifying Exception Raised on less than Order a_coeff Elements
Details:
  TestName: test_exception_when_less_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify whether the function raises the correct exception when 'a_coeffs' does not contain enough elements relative to the order of the IIRFilter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter with an order. Prepare 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' with a size less than the order + 1.
  Act: Call the 'set_coefficients' method of IIRFilter with the prepared 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs'.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError and check the error message.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function is enforcing the rule that the number of coefficients in 'a_coeffs' should be equal to the order plus 1. This directly impacts the effectiveness of the filter.

Scenario 3: Verifying Exception Raised on less than Order b_coeff Elements
Details:
  TestName: test_exception_when_less_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify whether the function raises the correct exception when 'b_coeffs' does not contain enough elements relative to the order of the IIRFilter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter with an order. Prepare 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' with a size less than the order + 1.
  Act: Call the 'set_coefficients' method of IIRFilter with the prepared 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs'.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError and check the error message.
Validation:
  This tests the business logic that selects the number of coefficients in 'b_coeffs' should be equal to the order plus 1. This plays a critical role in the filter's performance.

Scenario 4: Padding a_coeffs with Default Value
Details:
  TestName: test_a_coeffs_padding_with_default_value
  Description: This test is aimed at verifying if the function pads additional coefficient of '1.0' in 'a_coeffs' when the 'a_coeffs' list is less than the order of the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter with an order. Prepare an 'a_coeffs' list with a size less than the order and a 'b_coeffs' list with size equal to order plus 1.
  Act: Call the 'set_coefficients' method of IIRFilter with the prepared 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs'.
  Assert: Check if an additional coefficient of '1.0' is automatically added at beginning of 'a_coeffs'.
Validation:
  It's crucial to verify the business logic of padding 'a_coeffs' with the default mapping because it is a part of the method's specification and directly influences the filter's functionality.
