Scenario 1: Test the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the coefficients have been successfully set by comparing them with the input coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of setting coefficients is working as expected. The successful setting of coefficients is crucial for the correct functioning of the IIR filter.

Scenario 2: Test setting coefficients with a_coeffs missing a_0
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_missing_a0
  Description: This test is intended to verify the functionality where the a_0 coefficient is allowed to be missing and is set to default 1.0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs with size of order (missing a_0) and b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs have been successfully set with a_0 as 1.0 and the rest as input coefficients.
Validation:
  This test ensures the functionality of setting a_0 to 1.0 is working as expected, which is part of the business logic of setting coefficients.

Scenario 3: Test setting coefficients with a_coeffs size less than order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_a_coeffs_size_less_than_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify the error handling when the size of a_coeffs is less than the order of the filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs with size less than order and b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError with a message indicating the mismatch in sizes.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles the error condition where a_coeffs size is less than the order of the filter, which is important to maintain the integrity of the filter.

Scenario 4: Test setting coefficients with a_coeffs or b_coeffs size not equal to order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_coefficients_size_not_equal_to_order_plus_one
  Description: This test is intended to verify the error handling when the size of a_coeffs or b_coeffs is not equal to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs or b_coeffs with size not equal to order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError with a message indicating the mismatch in sizes.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles the error condition where the size of a_coeffs or b_coeffs is not equal to order + 1, which is crucial to maintain the integrity of the filter.
