Scenario 1: Testing the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the coefficients of the IIR filter are set correctly by checking the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the main functionality of setting coefficients works as expected. It verifies the correct working of the function in normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Testing with a_coeffs less than the filter order
Details:
  TestName: test_a_coeffs_less_than_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly handles the case when the number of a_coeffs is less than the filter order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the first element of a_coeffs is set to 1.0 and the rest of the coefficients are set correctly.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case of missing a_0 coefficient, and uses 1.0 as the default value as expected.

Scenario 3: Testing with number of a_coeffs not equal to order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_a_coeffs_not_equal_to_order_plus_one
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly raises a ValueError when the number of a_coeffs is not equal to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size not equal to order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function correctly raises an error for invalid a_coeffs length, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the filter coefficients.

Scenario 4: Testing with number of b_coeffs not equal to order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_b_coeffs_not_equal_to_order_plus_one
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly raises a ValueError when the number of b_coeffs is not equal to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function correctly raises an error for invalid b_coeffs length, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the filter coefficients.
