================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The function set_coefficients accepts input parameters without performing any type checking. This could lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors if the function is called with arguments that are not lists of floats.
Solution: Add type checking for the input arguments to ensure they are lists of floats. Raise a TypeError with a descriptive message if the type of the input is incorrect.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (CWE-639)
Issue: The function set_coefficients directly assigns the input parameters to instance variables. If these inputs contain sensitive information, this could lead to information leakage.
Solution: Consider using encapsulation and getter/setter methods to control access to instance variables.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79)
Issue: The function set_coefficients constructs error messages that include the input values. If these error messages are displayed in a web interface, this could lead to cross-site scripting attacks.
Solution: Ensure that any data that is included in an error message and displayed in a web interface is properly escaped. Alternatively, consider using generic error messages that do not include the input data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the coefficients of the IIR filter are set correctly by checking the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks the basic functionality of the set_coefficients method, which is crucial for the correct operation of the IIR filter.

Scenario 2: Testing the automatic addition of a default value when a_coeffs is missing an element
Details:
  TestName: test_automatically_adding_default_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly adds a default value when the a_coeffs list is missing an element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare an a_coeffs list of size order.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared a_coeffs and a valid b_coeffs list.
  Assert: Verify that the length of a_coeffs is now order+1 and that the first element is 1.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks the functionality of the method in handling scenarios where the a_coeffs list is missing an element.

Scenario 3: Testing the response to a_coeffs list with incorrect size
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_a_coeffs_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly raises a ValueError when the a_coeffs list has an incorrect size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare an a_coeffs list with an incorrect size.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared a_coeffs and a valid b_coeffs list.
  Assert: Verify that the method raises a ValueError with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks the method's error handling capabilities when dealing with incorrect input sizes, which is important for maintaining the integrity of the IIR filter.

Scenario 4: Testing the response to b_coeffs list with incorrect size
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_b_coeffs_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly raises a ValueError when the b_coeffs list has an incorrect size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a b_coeffs list with an incorrect size.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with a valid a_coeffs list and the prepared b_coeffs.
  Assert: Verify that the method raises a ValueError with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test checks the method's error handling capabilities when dealing with incorrect input sizes, which is important for maintaining the integrity of the IIR filter.
