================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Dependencies (CWE-937)
Issue: Using third-party libraries such as scipy can introduce security risks if they have vulnerabilities or if they're outdated.
Solution: Regularly update all third-party libraries to their latest versions and audit them for security issues.

Vulnerability: Insecure Input Handling (CWE-20)
Issue: While exceptions are raised for incorrect sizes of inputs, this function doesn't validate that the inputs are of the expected type (e.g., lists of numbers).
Solution: Consider adding type checking and handling scenarios where input types differ from expectations.

Vulnerability: Weak Error Handling (CWE-209)
Issue: The error messages in this function disclose the expected size of inputs, which could potentially be used for reverse engineering.
Solution: Consider more generic error messages that don't disclose implementation details.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Setting the Coefficients with valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs, where a_coeffs has same size as order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_valid_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the coefficients can be set when valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs are provided. This includes when a_coeffs has a size of order + 1, without pre-pending 1.0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the IIRFilter with a given order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method passing valid lists for a_coeffs and b_coeffs, each one of size order + 1.
  Assert: Verify the a_coeffs and b_coeffs of the instance have been set to the passed values.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function sets the coefficients correctly when the input is valid and follows the required lengths, which is part of the functional specifications.

Scenario 2: Setting the Coefficients with valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs, where a_coeffs has size less than order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_prepend_default
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method can handle when the a_coeffs size is less than the order. This includes when the function successfully prepends 1.0 to match the required size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the IIRFilter with a given order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method passing a_coeffs of size less than order, and b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs of the instance have a default value of 1.0 prepended, and if b_coeffs match the passed values.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle varying lengths of a_coeffs, specifically when it's less than the order, and is able to bring it to a correct size with the default value, contributing to the flexibility and robustness of the function.

Scenario 3: Setting the Coefficients with a_coeffs and b_coeffs of size not equivalent to order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_size_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to validate that the method raises a ValueError when the size of a_coeffs or b_coeffs is not equivalent to order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the IIRFilter with a given order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method passing a_coeffs or b_coeffs that don't match the expected size.
  Assert: A ValueError is expected to be raised with an appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it ensures the method validates the input size correctly, thereby enforcing the constraint that a_coeffs and b_coeffs size must be of order + 1 for the correct functioning of the filter.

Scenario 4: Setting the Coefficients with empty a_coeffs and b_coeffs
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_empty_coeffs
  Description: This test is meant to assess if the method can handle empty coefficients lists appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the IIRFilter with a given order.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients method passing empty lists for a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: A ValueError is expected to be raised with an appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the filter correctly handles and validates empty inputs, helping to prevent potential errors or inappropriate filter behavior.
