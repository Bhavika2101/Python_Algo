================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The provided code does not validate the type of the a_coeffs and b_coeffs parameters. If a non-list object is provided, the code could encounter unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Make sure to validate the type of the input parameters. You can use the isinstance() function to check if the passed parameters are indeed lists.

Vulnerability: Error Message Information Leak
Issue: The error messages provide specific details about the expected length of the a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists. This could potentially expose sensitive internal workings of your program to malicious users.
Solution: Make your error messages more generic. Instead of specifying the expected length, you could say something like 'Invalid filter coefficients provided.'

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the coefficients of the IIR filter are set correctly by checking the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the IIRFilter object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the main functionality of setting coefficients works as expected. It verifies the correct working of the function in normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Testing with a_coeffs of size less than order
Details:
  TestName: test_a_coeffs_less_than_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly handles the case when the size of a_coeffs is less than the order of the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order and valid b_coeffs of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that the a_coeffs attribute of the IIRFilter object is of size order+1 and the first element is 1.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case of a_coeffs being less than order, and fills the missing coefficient with a default value of 1.0.

Scenario 3: Testing with a_coeffs of incorrect size
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_size_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly raises an exception when a_coeffs is of incorrect size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size not equal to order+1 and valid b_coeffs of size order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that a ValueError is raised with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function correctly raises an exception when a_coeffs is of incorrect size, thus enforcing the correct usage of the function.

Scenario 4: Testing with b_coeffs of incorrect size
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_size_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method correctly raises an exception when b_coeffs is of incorrect size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid a_coeffs of size order+1 and b_coeffs of size not equal to order+1.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Verify that a ValueError is raised with the correct error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function correctly raises an exception when b_coeffs is of incorrect size, thus enforcing the correct usage of the function.
