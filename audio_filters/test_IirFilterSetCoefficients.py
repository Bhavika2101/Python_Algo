================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated input (CWE-20)
Issue: The function set_coefficients accepts input parameters without performing any type checking. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the function is called with parameters of incorrect types.
Solution: Add type checking to ensure that the input parameters are of the expected types. Raise a TypeError if the incorrect type is provided.

Vulnerability: Potential Denial of Service (DoS) (CWE-400)
Issue: The function set_coefficients does not limit the size of the input lists a_coeffs and b_coeffs. An attacker could potentially cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by providing excessively large lists, causing the program to consume large amounts of memory.
Solution: Implement a limit on the size of the input lists. If a list exceeds this limit, the function should raise an error.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the coefficients have been successfully set by comparing them with the input coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of setting coefficients is working as expected. The successful execution of this scenario would mean the function is correctly setting the coefficients.

Scenario 2: Test the setting of coefficients when a_coeffs list has less than order elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the automatic addition of 1.0 to the a_coeffs list when its size is less than the order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size less than order and valid b_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs have been successfully set by comparing them with the input coefficients, considering the added 1.0.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to verify the function's ability to handle cases where a_coeffs list has less than order elements. The successful execution would mean the function is correctly adding 1.0 to the a_coeffs list when needed.

Scenario 3: Test the setting of coefficients when a_coeffs list has more than order + 1 elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_more_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's exception handling when the a_coeffs list has more than order + 1 elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs of size more than order + 1 and valid b_coeffs.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError to be raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles cases where a_coeffs list has more than order + 1 elements. The successful execution would mean the function is correctly raising an exception in such cases.

Scenario 4: Test the setting of coefficients when b_coeffs list has less or more than order + 1 elements
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_invalid_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's exception handling when the b_coeffs list has less or more than order + 1 elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs of size not equal to order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError to be raised.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to verify the function's ability to handle cases where b_coeffs list has less or more than order + 1 elements. The successful execution would mean the function is correctly raising an exception in such cases.
