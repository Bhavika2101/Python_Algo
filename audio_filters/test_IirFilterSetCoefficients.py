================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The function set_coefficients accepts lists a_coeffs and b_coeffs without checking whether they are indeed lists or not, and whether they contain float elements only. Providing a different type of input could result in an unwanted runtime error.
Solution: Add input type validation checks at the start of the function to ensure that both a_coeffs and b_coeffs are of type list and contain float elements only.

Vulnerability: Mismatch in Error Message (CWE-209)
Issue: In the error message for the b_coeffs, it incorrectly uses the length of a_coeffs. If b_coeffs is less or more than the required size, the error message will indicate the incorrect length leading to confusion during debugging.
Solution: In the error message for b_coeffs' length validation, use len(b_coeffs) instead of len(a_coeffs).

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate normal execution of set_coefficients method
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_normal_execution
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the set_coefficients method works as expected with proper input, i.e., the length of a_coeffs and b_coeffs is order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter instance with an order of 2. Prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs each with a length of 3.
  Act: Call IIRFilter.set_coefficients with a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check that the a_coeffs and b_coeffs have been stored in the IIRFilter instance.
Validation:
  The normal execution path of the function is a critical part of the business logic. This test case verifies that when valid inputs are provided, the function works as expected.

Scenario 2: Validate behavior when a_coeffs length is less than order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_a_coeffs_less_than_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the set_coefficients method modifies the a_coeffs if their length is less than order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter instance with an order of 2. Prepare a_coeffs with a length of 1 and b_coeffs with a length of 3.
  Act: Call IIRFilter.set_coefficients with a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check that the a_coeffs in the IIRFilter instance have been modified to be order + 1 in length.
Validation:
  The method is designed to accommodate users forgetting to insert the initial coefficient 'a_0'. This test verifies this business logic by ensuring the method correctly inserts the 1.0 default a_0 value when it's not provided.

Scenario 3: Validate error when a_coeffs length is not equal to order+1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_a_coeffs_error
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the set_coefficients method raises a ValueError when the length of a_coeffs is not equal to order+1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter instance with an order of 2. Prepare a_coeffs with a length of 4 and b_coeffs with a length of 3.
  Act: Call IIRFilter.set_coefficients with a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError indicating that the a_coeffs length is not equal to order+1.
Validation:
  The method needs to enforce that a_coeffs has an appropriate length in relation with the filter order. This test verifies that the method correctly enforces this business logic by raising an error when the condition is not met.

Scenario 4: Validate error when b_coeffs length is not equal to order+1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_b_coeffs_error
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the set_coefficients method raises a ValueError when the length of b_coeffs is not equal to order+1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IIRFilter instance with an order of 2. Prepare a_coeffs with a length of 3 and b_coeffs with a length of 2.
  Act: Call IIRFilter.set_coefficients with a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError indicating that the b_coeffs length is not equal to order+1.
Validation:
  The method needs to enforce that b_coeffs has an appropriate length in relation with the filter order. This test verifies that the method correctly enforces this business logic by raising an error when the condition is not met.
