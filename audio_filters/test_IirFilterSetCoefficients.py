================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Inappropriate input validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The function set_coefficients takes a list of coefficients but does not validate that these coefficients are of the expected type (floats). If something other than a float is passed in the list, it could result in unexpected behavior.
Solution: Implement validation to ensure that all elements in the a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists are of the expected type (float) before proceeding with the rest of the function.

Vulnerability: Error message information leakage (CWE-209)
Issue: Error messages generated when the list lengths are checked give away internal workings of the function, such as the expected length of the lists and their names, which can be useful information for an attacker.
Solution: Revise error messages to be less specific about the function's internal processing logic or consider implementing a logging system that can record detailed logs and show the users more generic error messages.

Vulnerability: Potential Denial of Service (CWE-400)
Issue: The function set_coefficients does not limit the size of lists a_coeffs and b_coeffs. An attacker could potentially pass extremely large lists to this function, consuming large amounts of memory and potentially slowing or crashing the system.
Solution: Limit the size of the inputs, or implement a mechanism to handle extraordinarily large inputs gracefully, such as streaming the processing of the data or implementing quotas.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test setting correct coefficients for the IIR filter
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_success
  Description: This test will verify if the method 'set_coefficients' successfully sets the coefficients 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' when provided with lists of valid size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class and prepare valid 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' lists.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with these lists.
  Assert: Expect 'self.a_coeffs' and 'self.b_coeffs' arrays to be equal to the provided lists.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function "set_coefficients" correctly sets the coefficients a_coeffs and b_coeffs, reflecting the normal behavior of this function.

Scenario 2: Test setting coefficients for the IIR filter with fewer a_coeffs
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_fewer_a_coeffs
  Description: This test verifies that when a_coeffs is shorter than expected, a default value of 1.0 gets applied at the beginning of a_coeffs but only when a_coeffs is shorter by one element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class and prepare 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' lists where a_coeffs is shorter by one element.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with these lists.
  Assert: Expect 'self.a_coeffs' to be equal to the provided list with 1.0 added at the start.
Validation:
  This test validates how the function "set_coefficients" handles a specific edge case: a_coeffs being one element shorter.

Scenario 3: Test the set_coefficients method with a_coeffs and b_coeffs of incorrect lengths.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_incorrect_length
  Description: This test will validate It verifies that the function 'set_coefficients' raises an exception if a_coeffs and b_coeffs are not the correct lengths (neither order+1 nor order in the case of a_coeffs).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class and prepare 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' lists of incorrect lengths.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with these lists.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  The test makes sure the program guards against incorrect input types, and raises specific exceptions when necessary. 

Scenario 4: Test the set_coefficients method with a_coeffs and b_coeffs of empty lists.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_empty_list
  Description: This test verifies that the function 'set_coefficients' raises an exception if a_coeffs and b_coeffs are empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class and prepare 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' as empty lists.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with these lists.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  This test checks the function "set_coefficients" to throw errors for input cases where both 'a_coeffs' and 'b_coeffs' are empty lists.
