Scenario 1: Test the successful setting of coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_set_coefficients
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of valid coefficients to the IIR filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid coefficients of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the coefficients have been set correctly by comparing them with the input coefficients.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function is able to correctly set the coefficients when provided with valid inputs. This is important as it is the main purpose of the function as per its specification.

Scenario 2: Test setting of coefficients with a_coeffs having less elements than order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful setting of coefficients with a_coeffs having less elements than the order, and the default value of 1.0 is added.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs with less elements than the order and valid b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if the a_coeffs have been set correctly by comparing them with the input a_coeffs and the added default value.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function is able to correctly set the coefficients when a_coeffs has less elements than the order and a default value of 1.0 is added. This is important as it is a special case in the function's specification.

Scenario 3: Test setting of coefficients with a_coeffs having more elements than order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_more_a_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises a ValueError when a_coeffs has more elements than order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare a_coeffs with more elements than the order + 1 and valid b_coeffs of size order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function correctly raises an error when a_coeffs has more elements than order + 1, as per its specification.

Scenario 4: Test setting of coefficients with b_coeffs having less elements than order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_less_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises a ValueError when b_coeffs has less elements than order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid a_coeffs of size order + 1 and b_coeffs with less elements than the order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function correctly raises an error when b_coeffs has less elements than order + 1, as per its specification.

Scenario 5: Test setting of coefficients with b_coeffs having more elements than order + 1
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_with_more_b_coeffs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises a ValueError when b_coeffs has more elements than order + 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a certain order, and prepare valid a_coeffs of size order + 1 and b_coeffs with more elements than the order + 1.
  Act: Invoke the set_coefficients function with the prepared coefficients.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function correctly raises an error when b_coeffs has more elements than order + 1, as per its specification.
