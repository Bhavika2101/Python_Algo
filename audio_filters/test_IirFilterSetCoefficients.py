================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: There is no check for the types of the input parameters a_coeffs and b_coeffs. If these inputs are not of the expected type (List of floats), the code may cause unexpected behaviour or throw errors.
Solution: Add checks to ensure a_coeffs and b_coeffs are in correct formats and types. This could be done using the isinstance() function in Python.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The scipy module, a third-party module, is used without any checks. If scipy is compromised, code execution could be manipulated.
Solution: Ensure that third-party modules are up-to-date, come from trusted sources and are verified for integrity. Consider using a virtual environment to isolate the installation of these modules from the global Python environment.

Vulnerability: CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
Issue: The function set_coefficients() does not capture potential exceptions raised while setting a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
Solution: Encapsulate risky code sections within try/except blocks to capture specific exceptions. Handle exceptions in a way that ensures safe failure of the application and prevents exposure of sensitive information.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the set_coefficients when a_coeffs is less than the filter order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_a_coeffs_less_than_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify whether the set_coefficients function behaves correctly when the a_coeffs list contains fewer elements than the order of the filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a specific order and define a a_coeffs and b_coeffs list that both contain fewer elements than the filter order.
  Act: Call set_coefficients with the a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError with a specific message that informs us a_coeffs should have more elements.
Validation:
  This tests that the function has a built-in error checking mechanism for when a_coeffs have too few elements, which is important to ensure correct operation and data integrity.

Scenario 2: Testing the set_coefficients when a_coeffs is equal to the filter order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_a_coeffs_equals_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the set_coefficients function behaves correctly when the a_coeffs list contains the exact number of elements as the order of the filter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object with a specific order and define a a_coeffs and b_coeffs list that both contain an equal number of elements as the filter order.
  Act: Call set_coefficients with a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check that the IIRFilter object's a_coeffs property has been altered correctly and no exception is raised.
Validation:
  This test is significant as it ensures the functionality of the method given the expected normal input, as per its specifications.

Scenario 3: Testing the set_coefficients when b_coeffs is not exactly the same as the filter order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_b_coeffs_n_equals_order
  Description: Test verifies whether set_coefficients function behaves correctly when b_coeffs list contains different elements than the filter order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize IIRFilter object with particular order and define a_coeffs list and b_coeffs list containing fewer or more elements than the filter order.
  Act: Call set_coefficients with a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Expect ValueError with message informing that b_coeffs should have equal number of elements as the filter order.
Validation:
  This confirms the function's built-in error checking mechanism for b_coeffs elements, which is crucial for maintaining correct operation and data integrity.

Scenario 4: Testing the set_coefficients when a_coeffs and b_coeffs are equal to filter order
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_a_b_equals_order
  Description: This test verifies whether the set_coefficients function behaves correctly when both a_coeff and b_coeff are equal to the filter's order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the IIRFilter object and prepare a_coeffs and b_coeffs with equal elements to the filter order.
  Act: Invoke set_coefficients with a_coeffs and b_coeffs.
  Assert: Check that the IIRFilter's a_coeffs and b_coeffs have been correctly set and no exception has been raised.
Validation:
  Validating this scenario ensures that the function works well when given valid inputs, keeping the business scenario intact.
