Scenario 1: Verify the addition of two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_get_num_positive_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function directly takes the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function with two positive integers.
  Assert: The function should return the correct sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the basic case of adding two positive integers. The expected result is directly related to the function's purpose of adding two numbers.

Scenario 2: Verify the addition of two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_get_num_negative_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function directly takes the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function with two negative integers.
  Assert: The function should return the correct sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the case of adding two negative integers. The expected result is directly related to the function's purpose of adding two numbers.

Scenario 3: Verify the addition of a positive integer and a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_get_num_positive_and_negative_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add a positive integer and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function directly takes the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function with a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Assert: The function should return the correct sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the case of adding a positive integer and a negative integer. The expected result is directly related to the function's purpose of adding two numbers.

Scenario 4: Verify the addition of two floating point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_get_num_floating_point_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add two floating point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function directly takes the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function with two floating point numbers.
  Assert: The function should return the correct sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the case of adding two floating point numbers. The expected result is directly related to the function's purpose of adding two numbers.
