```
Scenario 1: Successful encryption and decryption
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_encryption_and_decryption
  Description: This test verifies that the main function correctly encrypts and then decrypts a message, returning the original message.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the message is hardcoded in the function.
  Act: Call the main function.
  Assert: Check that the decrypted message is equal to the original message ("HELLO WORLD").
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the encrypt and decrypt functions are working correctly together. The expected result is that the original message is returned after encryption and decryption, demonstrating that the functions are correctly reversing each other's operations.

Scenario 2: Correct use of the encryption key
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_use_of_encryption_key
  Description: This test verifies that the same encryption key is used for both encryption and decryption in the main function.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the message and key are hardcoded in the function.
  Act: Call the main function.
  Assert: Check that the decrypted message is equal to the original message ("HELLO WORLD").
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the correct key is being used to decrypt the message. The expected result is that the original message is returned after encryption and decryption, demonstrating that the same key is being used for both processes.

Scenario 3: Correct handling of block size
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_handling_of_block_size
  Description: This test verifies that the main function correctly handles the block size for the permutation cipher, ensuring that blocks of the correct size are encrypted and decrypted.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the message and block size are hardcoded in the function.
  Act: Call the main function.
  Assert: Check that the decrypted message is equal to the original message ("HELLO WORLD").
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the block size is being correctly handled by the encrypt and decrypt functions. The expected result is that the original message is returned after encryption and decryption, demonstrating that blocks of the correct size are being processed.

Scenario 4: Correct handling of uppercase letters
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_handling_of_uppercase_letters
  Description: This test verifies that the main function correctly handles uppercase letters, as the permutation cipher should be case-insensitive.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the message is hardcoded in the function.
  Act: Call the main function.
  Assert: Check that the decrypted message is equal to the original message ("HELLO WORLD").
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the encrypt and decrypt functions correctly handle uppercase letters. The expected result is that the original message is returned after encryption and decryption, demonstrating that the functions are case-insensitive.
