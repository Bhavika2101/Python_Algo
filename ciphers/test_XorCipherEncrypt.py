```
Scenario 1: Test when 'content' is an empty string and a key is provided
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_empty_content
  Description: This test verifies that the method returns an empty list when the 'content' parameter is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the XORCipher class with a default key.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method, passing an empty string as 'content' and any key as 'key'.
  Assert: The output should be an empty list.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case when 'content' is an empty string. The expected outcome aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements, as it correctly returns an empty list.

Scenario 2: Test when 'content' is a non-empty string and a key is provided
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_non_empty_content
  Description: This test verifies that the method returns a list of characters when the 'content' parameter is a non-empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the XORCipher class with a default key.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method, passing a non-empty string as 'content' and any key as 'key'.
  Assert: The output should be a list of characters.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case when 'content' is a non-empty string. The expected outcome aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements, as it correctly returns a list of characters.

Scenario 3: Test when 'key' is negative
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_negative_key
  Description: This test verifies that the method correctly handles a negative 'key'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the XORCipher class with a default key.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method, passing any string as 'content' and a negative integer as 'key'.
  Assert: The output should be a list of characters.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case when 'key' is negative. The expected outcome aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements, as it correctly returns a list of characters.

Scenario 4: Test when 'key' is greater than 255
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_key_greater_than_255
  Description: This test verifies that the method correctly handles a 'key' that is greater than 255.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the XORCipher class with a default key.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method, passing any string as 'content' and an integer greater than 255 as 'key'.
  Assert: The output should be a list of characters.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case when 'key' is greater than 255. The expected outcome aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements, as it correctly returns a list of characters.
  
Scenario 5: Test when 'key' is not provided
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_key_not_provided
  Description: This test verifies that the method uses the key provided in the constructor if 'key' is not passed in the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the XORCipher class with a non-default key.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method, passing any string as 'content' and no 'key'.
  Assert: The output should be a list of characters that corresponds to the key provided in the constructor.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly uses the key provided in the constructor when 'key' is not passed in the method. The expected outcome aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.
