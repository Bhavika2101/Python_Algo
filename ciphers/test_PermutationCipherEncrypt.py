```
Scenario 1: Validating the encryption with known inputs and outputs
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_known_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the encrypt function works correctly by providing known inputs and confirming the output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a known message and a key with a block_size.
  Act: Call the encrypt function with the known message, key and block_size.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected encrypted message and key.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the encrypt function works as expected with known inputs. If the function passes this test, it can be assumed that it is correctly implementing the permutation cipher algorithm.

Scenario 2: Validating the encryption with randomly generated inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_random_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the encrypt function works correctly by providing randomly generated inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a random message of a certain length.
  Act: Call the encrypt function with the random message.
  Assert: Check that the length of the encrypted message is equal to the length of the original message.
Validation:
  This test is important to check that the encrypt function can handle a variety of input data. The length of the encrypted message should equal the length of the original message, indicating that each character in the original message has been encrypted.

Scenario 3: Validating the encryption with a key and block_size provided
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_with_key_and_block_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the encrypt function works correctly when a key and block_size are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a known message and a key with a block_size.
  Act: Call the encrypt function with the known message, key and block_size.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected encrypted message and key.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the encrypt function correctly uses the provided key and block_size for encryption. If the function passes this test, it can be assumed that it is correctly using the provided key and block_size.

Scenario 4: Validating the encryption with a key and no block_size provided
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_with_key_no_block_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the encrypt function works correctly when a key is provided but no block_size is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a known message and a key.
  Act: Call the encrypt function with the known message and key.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected encrypted message and key.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the encrypt function correctly generates a valid block_size when none is provided. If the function passes this test, it can be assumed that it is correctly generating a valid block_size.

Scenario 5: Validating the encryption with no key and a block_size provided
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_no_key_with_block_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the encrypt function works correctly when no key is provided but a block_size is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a known message and a block_size.
  Act: Call the encrypt function with the known message and block_size.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected encrypted message and key.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the encrypt function correctly generates a permutation key when none is provided. If the function passes this test, it can be assumed that it is correctly generating a permutation key.
