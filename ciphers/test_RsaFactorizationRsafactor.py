Scenario 1: Valid Inputs with known factors
Details:
  TestName: test_rsafactor_valid_known_factors
  Description: This test is intended to verify the functionality of the rsafactor function with valid inputs where the factors of N are known.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we're directly passing the parameters to the function.
  Act: The function rsafactor will be invoked with parameters (3, 16971, 25777).
  Assert: The expected outcome is [149, 173] and it will be checked by comparing the function's output with the expected outcome.
Validation:
  It's important to test the function's ability to correctly factor the RSA modulus with known factors. This will validate that the function accurately implements the RSA factoring algorithm when given valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Valid Inputs with unknown factors
Details:
  TestName: test_rsafactor_valid_unknown_factors
  Description: This test is intended to verify the functionality of the rsafactor function with valid inputs where the factors of N are unknown.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we're directly passing the parameters to the function.
  Act: The function rsafactor will be invoked with parameters (7331, 11, 27233).
  Assert: The output of the function will be checked to ensure it's a list of two prime numbers whose product equals N.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify the function's capability to accurately factor the RSA modulus when the factors are unknown. This ensures that the function can be used in real-world scenarios where the factors are not known in advance.

Scenario 3: Edge case with smallest possible valid inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_rsafactor_edge_case_smallest_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the functionality of the rsafactor function with the smallest possible valid inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we're directly passing the parameters to the function.
  Act: The function rsafactor will be invoked with parameters (1, 1, 2).
  Assert: The expected outcome is [1, 2] and it will be checked by comparing the function's output with the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly at the lower edge of its input domain. This verifies that the function's implementation handles the smallest possible inputs correctly.

Scenario 4: Error case with invalid inputs where d*e is not greater than N
Details:
  TestName: test_rsafactor_error_case_invalid_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the functionality of the rsafactor function with invalid inputs where d*e is not greater than N.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we're directly passing the parameters to the function.
  Act: The function rsafactor will be invoked with parameters (1, 1, 10).
  Assert: The test will check if the function raises an exception or returns an incorrect result.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles invalid inputs. This verifies the robustness of the function's implementation in the face of incorrect usage.
