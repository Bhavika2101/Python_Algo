Scenario 1: Successful File Encryption
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_file_success
  Description: To verify that the function successfully encrypts a file when provided with valid inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a test file with some content and initialize the object with a key.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt_file function on the test file.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True and the content of the output file is encrypted as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the basic functionality of the function. If the function can't successfully encrypt a file, it does not meet its specifications.

Scenario 2: File Encryption with Key Greater than 255
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_file_large_key
  Description: To verify that the function handles keys greater than 255 correctly by applying modulo operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a test file with some content and initialize the object with a key greater than 255.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt_file function on the test file.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True and the content of the output file is encrypted as if the key was key % 256.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function correctly handles keys outside the range of a byte. The function specification requires this behavior.

Scenario 3: File Encryption with Empty File
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_empty_file
  Description: To verify that the function handles empty files correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty test file and initialize the object with a key.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt_file function on the empty file.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True and the output file is also empty.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function correctly handles edge cases of input. The function should not error out or create non-empty output for an empty input file.

Scenario 4: File Encryption with Non-Existent File
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_nonexistent_file
  Description: To verify that the function handles non-existent files correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a file name that does not exist and initialize the object with a key.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt_file function on the non-existent file.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function correctly handles error conditions. It should not throw an unhandled exception or return True when it can't open the input file.

Scenario 5: File Encryption without Passing Key
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_file_no_key
  Description: To verify that the function uses the key from the constructor when no key is passed to it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a test file with some content and initialize the object with a key.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt_file function on the test file without passing a key.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True and the content of the output file is encrypted as if the key from the constructor was used.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function correctly uses the key from the constructor when no key is passed to it. The function specification requires this behavior.
