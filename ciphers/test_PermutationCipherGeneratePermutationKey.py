Scenario 1: Test for valid permutation key generation with a given block size
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_permutation_key
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function generate_permutation_key is able to generate a valid permutation key of a given block size.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function generate_permutation_key does not require any initial state.
  Act: Invoke the function generate_permutation_key with a block size of 5.
  Assert: Check if the output is a list of unique integers from 0 to 4 in any order.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the main functionality of the function generate_permutation_key. The expected result is in line with the function's specification to generate a permutation key of a given block size.

Scenario 2: Test for permutation key generation with minimum block size
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_block_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function generate_permutation_key is able to generate a valid permutation key with the minimum block size of 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function generate_permutation_key does not require any initial state.
  Act: Invoke the function generate_permutation_key with a block size of 1.
  Assert: Check if the output is a list containing only the integer 0.
Validation:
  This test is important as it tests the edge case of the minimum block size. The expected result is in line with the function's specification to generate a permutation key of a given block size.

Scenario 3: Test for permutation key generation with a large block size
Details:
  TestName: test_large_block_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function generate_permutation_key is able to handle large block sizes and generate a valid permutation key.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function generate_permutation_key does not require any initial state.
  Act: Invoke the function generate_permutation_key with a large block size e.g. 10,000.
  Assert: Check if the output is a list of unique integers from 0 to 9,999 in any order.
Validation:
  This test is important as it tests the function's ability to handle large inputs. The expected result is in line with the function's specification to generate a permutation key of a given block size.

Scenario 4: Test for permutation key generation with negative block size
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_block_size
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function generate_permutation_key is able to handle negative block sizes and return an appropriate response.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function generate_permutation_key does not require any initial state.
  Act: Invoke the function generate_permutation_key with a negative block size e.g. -5.
  Assert: Check if the output is an empty list as there are no valid permutation keys for a negative block size.
Validation:
  This test is important as it tests the function's ability to handle invalid inputs. The expected result is in line with the function's specification to generate a permutation key of a given block size.
