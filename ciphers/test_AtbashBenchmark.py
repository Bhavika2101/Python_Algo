Scenario 1: Validate the execution time of atbash_slow function
Details:
  TestName: test_time_atbash_slow
  Description: This test is intended to check the execution time of the atbash_slow function and ensure it's within acceptable limits.
Execution:
  Arrange: Import the required modules and define the atbash_slow function as well as the benchmark function.
  Act: Invoke the benchmark function.
  Assert: Check if the execution time of the atbash_slow function is within the expected range.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to ensure the efficiency of the atbash_slow function. The execution time should be within an acceptable range for the function to be considered efficient.

Scenario 2: Validate the execution time of atbash function
Details:
  TestName: test_time_atbash
  Description: This test is intended to check the execution time of the atbash function and ensure it's within acceptable limits.
Execution:
  Arrange: Import the required modules and define the atbash function as well as the benchmark function.
  Act: Invoke the benchmark function.
  Assert: Check if the execution time of the atbash function is within the expected range.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to ensure the efficiency of the atbash function. The execution time should be within an acceptable range for the function to be considered efficient.

Scenario 3: Compare the execution time of atbash_slow and atbash functions
Details:
  TestName: test_compare_atbash_and_atbash_slow
  Description: This test is intended to compare the execution time of the atbash and atbash_slow functions to determine which one is more efficient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Import the required modules and define the atbash and atbash_slow functions as well as the benchmark function.
  Act: Invoke the benchmark function.
  Assert: Check if the execution time of the atbash function is less than the execution time of the atbash_slow function.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to determine which function is more efficient. The function with less execution time is considered more efficient.
