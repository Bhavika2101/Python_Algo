```
Scenario 1: Validate that the function returns a valid block size that is a factor of the message length.
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_valid_block_size_returns_factor
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns a valid block size that is a factor of the message length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a seed for the random number generator and a message length.
  Act: Call the generate_valid_block_size function with the message length as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned block size is a factor of the message length.
Validation:
  This test is important to validate the primary functionality of the function. The expected result is tied to the function's specification that it should return a block size that is a factor of the message length.

Scenario 2: Validate that the function does not return 1 as a block size.
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_valid_block_size_does_not_return_one
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function does not return 1 as a block size, even though 1 is a factor of any number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a seed for the random number generator and a message length.
  Act: Call the generate_valid_block_size function with the message length as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned block size is not 1.
Validation:
  This test is important as 1 is technically a factor of any number, but should not be considered a valid block size. The expected result is tied to the function's specification and business requirements that the block size should be between 2 and the message length.

Scenario 3: Validate that the function returns an error when the message length is less than 2.
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_valid_block_size_error_on_less_than_two
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises an error when the message length is less than 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a seed for the random number generator and a message length of less than 2.
  Act: Call the generate_valid_block_size function with the message length as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that an error is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important as the function is expected to handle message lengths of 2 or more. The expected result is tied to the function's specification and business requirements.

Scenario 4: Validate that the function can handle large message lengths.
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_valid_block_size_handles_large_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle large message lengths without errors or performance issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a seed for the random number generator and a large message length.
  Act: Call the generate_valid_block_size function with the message length as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that a valid block size is returned without any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle large inputs, which is a common requirement in real-world applications. The expected result is tied to the function's specification and performance requirements.
