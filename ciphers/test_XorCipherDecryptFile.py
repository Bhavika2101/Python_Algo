```
Scenario 1: Valid decryption of file content with a specified key
Details:
  TestName: test_decrypt_file_with_valid_key
  Description: This test verifies that the decrypt_file function can successfully decrypt a file's content when a valid key is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file with encrypted content and a valid decryption key.
  Act: Call the decrypt_file function with the filename and the key as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True and the content of the output file matches the expected decrypted content.
Validation:
  This test is important as it validates the fundamental functionality of the decrypt_file method. It ensures that the method correctly decrypts the file's content when provided with a valid key.

Scenario 2: Decryption of file content with a key greater than 255
Details:
  TestName: test_decrypt_file_with_key_greater_than_255
  Description: This test verifies that the decrypt_file function handles keys greater than 255 by taking the modulus 256 of the key.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file with encrypted content and a key greater than 255.
  Act: Call the decrypt_file function with the filename and the key as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True and the content of the output file matches the expected decrypted content.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the decrypt_file method correctly handles keys greater than 255, in line with the function's specifications.

Scenario 3: Decryption of file content with an empty key
Details:
  TestName: test_decrypt_file_with_empty_key
  Description: This test checks that the decrypt_file function uses the default key when no key is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file with encrypted content.
  Act: Call the decrypt_file function with the filename and without a key.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True and the content of the output file matches the expected decrypted content.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the decrypt_file method correctly applies the default key when no key is provided, ensuring the function's robustness and usability.

Scenario 4: Decryption of an empty file
Details:
  TestName: test_decrypt_empty_file
  Description: This test checks that the decrypt_file function can handle an empty file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty file.
  Act: Call the decrypt_file function with the filename and a valid key.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True and the output file is also empty.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the function's ability to handle edge cases, such as an empty file.

Scenario 5: Attempt to decrypt a non-existent file
Details:
  TestName: test_decrypt_non_existent_file
  Description: This test verifies that the decrypt_file function returns False when attempting to decrypt a file that does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: No file setup is needed as the file does not exist.
  Act: Call the decrypt_file function with a non-existent filename and a valid key.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it checks the function's error handling capabilities when provided with invalid input, ensuring the function's robustness.
