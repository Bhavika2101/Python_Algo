Scenario 1: Successful Decryption of a Message
Details:
  TestName: test_decrypt_success
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the decrypt function successfully decrypts an encrypted message using the correct permutation key.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an encrypted message and its corresponding key.
  Act: Invoke the decrypt function, passing in the encrypted message and key.
  Assert: Check that the returned string matches the original message before it was encrypted.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the core functionality of the decrypt function is working correctly. The expected result is directly related to the function's specifications and business requirements, as the function should be able to correctly decrypt a message when given the correct key.

Scenario 2: Decryption with Incorrect Key Length
Details:
  TestName: test_decrypt_incorrect_key_length
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the decrypt function when the length of the key does not match the block size of the encrypted message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an encrypted message and a key whose length does not match the block size of the encrypted message.
  Act: Invoke the decrypt function, passing in the encrypted message and the key.
  Assert: Check that the returned string does not match the original message before it was encrypted.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the decrypt function correctly handles cases where the key length does not match the block size of the encrypted message. The expected result is related to the function's specifications and business requirements, as it should be impossible to correctly decrypt a message with an incorrect key.

Scenario 3: Decryption with Empty String
Details:
  TestName: test_decrypt_empty_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the decrypt function when the encrypted message is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty string and a key.
  Act: Invoke the decrypt function, passing in the empty string and the key.
  Assert: Check that the returned string is also an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the decrypt function correctly handles edge case where the encrypted message is an empty string. The expected result is related to the function's specifications and business requirements, as an empty string should decrypt to an empty string regardless of the key.

Scenario 4: Decryption with Key Containing Duplicate Values
Details:
  TestName: test_decrypt_key_with_duplicates
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the decrypt function when the key contains duplicate values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an encrypted message and a key that contains duplicate values.
  Act: Invoke the decrypt function, passing in the encrypted message and the key.
  Assert: Check that the returned string does not match the original message before it was encrypted.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the decrypt function correctly handles cases where the key contains duplicate values. The expected result is related to the function's specifications and business requirements, as it should be impossible to correctly decrypt a message with a key that contains duplicate values.
