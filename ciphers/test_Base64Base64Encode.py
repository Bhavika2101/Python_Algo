================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The code uses the 'bin' function, which can lead to potential security risks if not used properly. The 'bin' function converts numbers into binary strings, which can be manipulated in unintended ways if not properly sanitized.
Solution: Ensure to validate and sanitize inputs before they are processed with the 'bin' function. Consider using a safer alternative if available.

Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The code does not check for potential integer overflow when performing operations on the binary_stream variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.
Solution: Add checks to ensure that integer operations do not result in overflow. Consider using a data type that can handle larger numbers if necessary.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not properly validate the type of the input data. It only checks if the input is of type 'bytes', but does not check for other invalid types that could potentially be passed to the function.
Solution: Improve the input validation to check for all possible invalid types that could be passed to the function. Throw an error or exception if an invalid type is detected.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Base64 encoding with data that doesn't require padding
Details:
  TestName: test_base64_encode_no_padding
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the base64_encode function correctly encodes data that doesn't require padding.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a bytes object whose length is a multiple of 6.
  Act: Invoke the base64_encode function with the prepared bytes object.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected Base64 encoded string.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it checks the function's ability to correctly encode data without requiring padding, which is a common use case.

Scenario 2: Test Base64 encoding with data that requires padding
Details:
  TestName: test_base64_encode_with_padding
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the base64_encode function correctly encodes data that requires padding.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a bytes object whose length is not a multiple of 6.
  Act: Invoke the base64_encode function with the prepared bytes object.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected Base64 encoded string, correctly padded.
Validation:
  This test is essential as it checks the function's ability to correctly encode and pad data, a common use case when the data length is not a multiple of 6.

Scenario 3: Test Base64 encoding with empty data
Details:
  TestName: test_base64_encode_empty_data
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the base64_encode function correctly handles an empty bytes object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty bytes object.
  Act: Invoke the base64_encode function with the empty bytes object.
  Assert: Check if the output is an empty string, as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function can handle edge cases such as empty input data.

Scenario 4: Test Base64 encoding with non-bytes data
Details:
  TestName: test_base64_encode_non_bytes_data
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the base64_encode function correctly raises a TypeError when the input data is not a bytes object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a non-bytes object.
  Act: Invoke the base64_encode function with the non-bytes object.
  Assert: Check if a TypeError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles and raises an error for inappropriate input data types.

Scenario 5: Test Base64 encoding with large data
Details:
  TestName: test_base64_encode_large_data
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the base64_encode function correctly encodes large data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a large bytes object.
  Act: Invoke the base64_encode function with the large bytes object.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected Base64 encoded string.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function performs correctly and efficiently when handling large data, which is a common use case in real-world applications.
