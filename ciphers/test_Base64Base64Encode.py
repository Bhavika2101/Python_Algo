================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The code uses the 'bin' function, which can lead to potential security risks if not properly sanitized or validated.
Solution: Replace the use of 'bin' function with a safer alternative, ensuring to sanitize and validate all inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function 'base64_encode' does not validate the input 'data' before processing. This could lead to potential security risks if the input is not in the expected format or contains malicious content.
Solution: Implement proper input validation to check the 'data' before processing. This could include checks for data type, format, and potential malicious content.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The function 'base64_encode' uses the input 'data' to determine the binary_stream and padding. If 'data' is manipulated by an attacker, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Ensure that the 'data' is trusted and validated before use. Consider implementing additional checks to prevent manipulation of 'data'.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Base64 encoding with regular data
Details:
  TestName: test_base64_encode_regular_data
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the base64_encode function correctly encodes regular byte data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a bytes object with a known string.
  Act: Invoke the base64_encode function with the bytes object.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected base64 encoding.
Validation:
  The function is expected to correctly encode regular byte data. This test validates that the function works as intended for typical, non-edge case usage.

Scenario 2: Test Base64 encoding with empty data
Details:
  TestName: test_base64_encode_empty_data
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the base64_encode function correctly handles empty byte data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty bytes object.
  Act: Invoke the base64_encode function with the empty bytes object.
  Assert: Check that the output is an empty bytes object.
Validation:
  The function is expected to return an empty bytes object when given an empty input. This test validates the function's behavior on edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test Base64 encoding with data that requires padding
Details:
  TestName: test_base64_encode_padding_data
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the base64_encode function correctly handles byte data that requires padding.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a bytes object with a known string that will require padding when encoded.
  Act: Invoke the base64_encode function with the bytes object.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected base64 encoding with the correct padding.
Validation:
  The function is expected to correctly handle data that requires padding. This test validates the function's behavior with different types of input data.

Scenario 4: Test Base64 encoding with non-bytes data
Details:
  TestName: test_base64_encode_non_bytes_data
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the base64_encode function correctly raises a TypeError when invoked with non-bytes data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a non-bytes object.
  Act: Invoke the base64_encode function with the non-bytes object.
  Assert: Check that a TypeError is raised.
Validation:
  The function is expected to raise a TypeError when invoked with non-bytes data. This test validates the function's error handling capabilities.
